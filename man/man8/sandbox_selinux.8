.SH "NAME"
sandbox_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the sandbox processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the sandbox processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The sandbox processes execute with the sandbox_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep sandbox_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The sandbox_t SELinux type can be entered via the "file_type" file type.  The default entrypoint paths for the sandbox_t domain are the following:"

all files on the system
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux sandbox policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their sandbox processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for sandbox:

.EX
.B sandbox_x_client_t, sandbox_net_client_t, sandbox_xserver_t, sandbox_x_t, sandbox_web_client_t, sandbox_min_t, sandbox_net_t, sandbox_web_t, sandbox_min_client_t, sandbox_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  sandbox policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run sandbox with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow unconfined users to transition to the chrome sandbox domains when running chrome-sandbox, you must turn on the unconfined_chrome_sandbox_transition boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P unconfined_chrome_sandbox_transition 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow unconfined users to transition to the chrome sandbox domains when running chrome-sandbox, you must turn on the unconfined_chrome_sandbox_transition boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P unconfined_chrome_sandbox_transition 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux sandbox policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their sandbox processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following file types are defined for sandbox:


.EX
.PP
.B sandbox_devpts_t
.EE

- Set files with the sandbox_devpts_t type, if you want to treat the files as sandbox devpts data.


.EX
.PP
.B sandbox_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the sandbox_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the sandbox_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B sandbox_file_t
.EE

- Set files with the sandbox_file_t type, if you want to treat the files as sandbox content.


.EX
.PP
.B sandbox_min_client_tmpfs_t
.EE

- Set files with the sandbox_min_client_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store sandbox min client files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.PP
.B sandbox_net_client_tmpfs_t
.EE

- Set files with the sandbox_net_client_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store sandbox net client files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.PP
.B sandbox_web_client_tmpfs_t
.EE

- Set files with the sandbox_web_client_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store sandbox web client files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.PP
.B sandbox_x_client_tmpfs_t
.EE

- Set files with the sandbox_x_client_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store sandbox x client files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.PP
.B sandbox_xserver_tmpfs_t
.EE

- Set files with the sandbox_xserver_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store sandbox xserver files on a tmpfs file system.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type sandbox_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B sandbox_file_t


.br
.B sandbox_tmpfs_type

	all sandbox content in tmpfs file systems
.br

.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.PP
If you want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd serve for the sandbox_min_t, sandbox_net_t, sandbox_web_client_t, sandbox_xserver_t, sandbox_web_t, sandbox_x_client_t, sandbox_x_t, sandbox_net_client_t, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos for the sandbox_min_t, sandbox_net_t, sandbox_web_client_t, sandbox_xserver_t, sandbox_web_t, sandbox_x_client_t, sandbox_x_t, sandbox_net_client_t, you must turn on the kerberos_enabled boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P kerberos_enabled 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
