.SH "NAME"
tcpd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the tcpd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the tcpd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  tcpd policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run tcpd with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow the Telepathy connection managers to connect to any generic TCP port, you must turn on the telepathy_tcp_connect_generic_network_ports boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P telepathy_tcp_connect_generic_network_ports 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow all daemons to use tcp wrappers, you must turn on the allow_daemons_use_tcp_wrapper boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P allow_daemons_use_tcp_wrapper 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow users to run TCP servers (bind to ports and accept connection from the same domain and outside users)  disabling this forces FTP passive mode and may change other protocols, you must turn on the user_tcp_server boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P user_tcp_server 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux tcpd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their tcpd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for tcpd:


.EX
.B tcpd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tcpd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the tcpd_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B tcpd_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tcpd_tmp_t type, if you want to store tcpd temporary files in the /tmp directories.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
