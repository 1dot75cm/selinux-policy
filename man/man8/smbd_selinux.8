.SH "NAME"
smbd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the smbd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the smbd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux smbd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their smbd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for smbd:


.EX
.B smbd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the smbd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the smbd_t domain.


.EX
.B smbd_keytab_t 
.EE

- Set files with the smbd_keytab_t context, if you want to treat the files as kerberos keytab files.


.EX
.B smbd_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the smbd_tmp_t context, if you want to store smbd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B smbd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the smbd_var_run_t context, if you want to store the smbd files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  smbd policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run smbd with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow samba to modify public files used for public file transfer services.  Files/Directories must be labeled public_content_rw_t., you must turn on the allow_smbd_anon_write boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P allow_smbd_anon_write 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
