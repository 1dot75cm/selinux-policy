.SH "NAME"
qdiskd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the qdiskd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the qdiskd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux qdiskd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their qdiskd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for qdiskd:


.EX
.B qdiskd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the qdiskd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the qdiskd_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B qdiskd_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the qdiskd_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store qdiskd files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.B qdiskd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the qdiskd_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the qdiskd files under the /var/lib directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B qdiskd_var_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the qdiskd_var_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as qdiskd var log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B qdiskd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the qdiskd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the qdiskd files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
