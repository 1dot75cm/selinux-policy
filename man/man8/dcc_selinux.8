.SH "NAME"
dcc_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the dcc processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the dcc processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux dcc policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their dcc processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for dcc:


.EX
.B dcc_client_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dcc_client_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the dcc_client_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B dcc_client_map_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dcc_client_map_t type, if you want to treat the files as dcc client map data.

.br
Paths: 
/var/lib/dcc/map, /etc/dcc/map, /var/dcc/map, /var/run/dcc/map
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B dcc_client_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dcc_client_tmp_t type, if you want to store dcc client temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B dcc_dbclean_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dcc_dbclean_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the dcc_dbclean_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B dcc_dbclean_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dcc_dbclean_tmp_t type, if you want to store dcc dbclean temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B dcc_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dcc_var_run_t type, if you want to store the dcc files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B dcc_var_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dcc_var_t type, if you want to store the  files under the /var directory.

.br
Paths: 
/etc/dcc(/.*)?, /var/dcc(/.*)?, /var/lib/dcc(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B dccd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dccd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the dccd_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B dccd_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dccd_tmp_t type, if you want to store dccd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B dccd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dccd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the dccd files under the /run directory.


.EX
.B dccifd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dccifd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the dccifd_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B dccifd_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dccifd_tmp_t type, if you want to store dccifd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B dccifd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dccifd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the dccifd files under the /run directory.

.br
Paths: 
/etc/dcc/dccifd, /var/run/dcc/dccifd
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B dccm_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dccm_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the dccm_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B dccm_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dccm_tmp_t type, if you want to store dccm temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B dccm_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dccm_var_run_t type, if you want to store the dccm files under the /run directory.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux dcc policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their dcc processes in as secure a method as possible.
