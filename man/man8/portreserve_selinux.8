.SH "NAME"
portreserve_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the portreserve processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the portreserve processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux portreserve policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their portreserve processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for portreserve:


.EX
.B portreserve_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the portreserve_etc_t type, if you want to store portreserve files in the /etc directories.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B portreserve_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the portreserve_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the portreserve_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/portreserve, /sbin/portreserve
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B portreserve_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the portreserve_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the portreserve_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B portreserve_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the portreserve_var_run_t type, if you want to store the portreserve files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
