.SH "NAME"
chronyd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the chronyd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the chronyd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux chronyd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their chronyd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for chronyd:


.EX
.B chronyd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the chronyd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the chronyd_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B chronyd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the chronyd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the chronyd_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B chronyd_keys_t 
.EE

- Set files with the chronyd_keys_t type, if you want to treat the files as chronyd keys data.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B chronyd_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the chronyd_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store chronyd files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.B chronyd_unit_file_t 
.EE

- Set files with the chronyd_unit_file_t type, if you want to treat the files as chronyd unit content.

.br
Paths: 
/lib/systemd/system/chronyd.*, /usr/lib/systemd/system/chronyd.*
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B chronyd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the chronyd_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the chronyd files under the /var/lib directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B chronyd_var_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the chronyd_var_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as chronyd var log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B chronyd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the chronyd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the chronyd files under the /run directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/run/chronyd(/.*), /var/run/chronyd\.sock, /var/run/chronyd\.pid
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux chronyd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their chronyd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for chronyd:
.EX

.B chronyd_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B udp 323
.EE
.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
