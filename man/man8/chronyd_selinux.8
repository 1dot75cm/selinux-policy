.SH "NAME"
chronyd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the chronyd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the chronyd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux chronyd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their chronyd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for chronyd:


.EX
.B chronyd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the chronyd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the chronyd_t domain.


.EX
.B chronyd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the chronyd_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the chronyd_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B chronyd_keys_t 
.EE

- Set files with the chronyd_keys_t context, if you want to treat the files as chronyd keys data.


.EX
.B chronyd_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the chronyd_tmpfs_t context, if you want to store chronyd files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.B chronyd_unit_file_t 
.EE

- Set files with the chronyd_unit_file_t context, if you want to treat the files as chronyd unit content.


.EX
.B chronyd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the chronyd_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the chronyd files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.B chronyd_var_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the chronyd_var_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as chronyd var log data, usually stored in /var/log.


.EX
.B chronyd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the chronyd_var_run_t context, if you want to store the chronyd files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux
