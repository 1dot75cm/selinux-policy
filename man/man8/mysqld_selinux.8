.SH "NAME"
mysqld_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the mysqld processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the mysqld processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  mysqld policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run mysqld with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow users to connect to the local mysql serve, you must turn on the allow_user_mysql_connect boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P allow_user_mysql_connect 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow mysqld to connect to all port, you must turn on the mysql_connect_any boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P mysql_connect_any 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux mysqld policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their mysqld processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for mysqld:


.EX
.B mysqld_db_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mysqld_db_t type, if you want to treat the files as mysqld database content.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B mysqld_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mysqld_etc_t type, if you want to store mysqld files in the /etc directories.

.br
Paths: 
/etc/my\.cnf, /etc/mysql(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B mysqld_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mysqld_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the mysqld_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/libexec/mysqld, /usr/sbin/mysqld(-max)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B mysqld_home_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mysqld_home_t type, if you want to store mysqld files in the users home directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B mysqld_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mysqld_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the mysqld_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B mysqld_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mysqld_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as mysqld log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B mysqld_safe_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mysqld_safe_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the mysqld_safe_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B mysqld_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mysqld_tmp_t type, if you want to store mysqld temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B mysqld_unit_file_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mysqld_unit_file_t type, if you want to treat the files as mysqld unit content.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B mysqld_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mysqld_var_run_t type, if you want to store the mysqld files under the /run directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/run/mysqld(/.*)?, /var/lib/mysql/mysql\.sock
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux mysqld policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their mysqld processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for mysqld:
.EX

.B mysqld_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 1186,3306,63132-63164
.EE
.EX

.B mysqlmanagerd_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 2273
.EE
.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
