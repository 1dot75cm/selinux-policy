.SH "NAME"
entropyd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the entropyd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the entropyd processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The entropyd processes execute with the entropyd_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier. 

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep entropyd_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The entropyd_t SELinux type can be entered via the "entropyd_exec_t" file type.  The default entrypoint paths for the entropyd_t domain are the following:"

/usr/sbin/haveged, /usr/sbin/audio-entropyd
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. 
SELinux entropyd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their entropyd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following process types are defined for entropyd:

.EX
.B entropyd_t 
.EE
.PP
Note: 
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE 
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  entropyd policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run entropyd with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow the use of the audio devices as the source for the entropy feeds, you must turn on the entropyd_use_audio boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P entropyd_use_audio 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow the use of the audio devices as the source for the entropy feeds, you must turn on the entropyd_use_audio boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P entropyd_use_audio 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux entropyd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their entropyd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for entropyd:


.EX
.PP
.B entropyd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the entropyd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the entropyd_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B entropyd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the entropyd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the entropyd files under the /run directory.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type entropyd_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B entropyd_var_run_t

	/var/run/haveged\.pid
.br
	/var/run/audio-entropyd\.pid
.br

.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.PP
If you want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd serve for the entropyd_t, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos for the entropyd_t, you must turn on the kerberos_enabled boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P kerberos_enabled 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
