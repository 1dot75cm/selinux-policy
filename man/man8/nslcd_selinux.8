.SH "NAME"
nslcd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the nslcd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the nslcd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux nslcd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their nslcd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for nslcd:


.EX
.B nslcd_conf_t 
.EE

- Set files with the nslcd_conf_t context, if you want to treat the files as nslcd configuration data, usually stored under the /etc directory.


.EX
.B nslcd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the nslcd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the nslcd_t domain.


.EX
.B nslcd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the nslcd_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the nslcd_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B nslcd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the nslcd_var_run_t context, if you want to store the nslcd files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
