.SH "NAME"
ypserv_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the ypserv processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the ypserv processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux ypserv policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ypserv processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for ypserv:


.EX
.B ypserv_conf_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ypserv_conf_t context, if you want to treat the files as ypserv configuration data, usually stored under the /etc directory.

.br
Path: 
/etc/ypserv\.conf

.EX
.B ypserv_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ypserv_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the ypserv_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/usr/sbin/ypserv

.EX
.B ypserv_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ypserv_var_run_t context, if you want to store the ypserv files under the /run directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/run/ypserv.*
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
