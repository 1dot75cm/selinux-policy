.SH "NAME"
apmd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the apmd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the apmd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux apmd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their apmd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for apmd:


.EX
.B apmd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the apmd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the apmd_t domain.


.EX
.B apmd_lock_t 
.EE

- Set files with the apmd_lock_t context, if you want to treat the files as apmd lock data.


.EX
.B apmd_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the apmd_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as apmd log data, usually stored in /var/log.


.EX
.B apmd_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the apmd_tmp_t context, if you want to store apmd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B apmd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the apmd_var_run_t context, if you want to store the apmd files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
