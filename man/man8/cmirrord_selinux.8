.SH "NAME"
cmirrord_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the cmirrord processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the cmirrord processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux cmirrord policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their cmirrord processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for cmirrord:


.EX
.B cmirrord_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cmirrord_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the cmirrord_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B cmirrord_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cmirrord_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the cmirrord_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B cmirrord_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cmirrord_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store cmirrord files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.B cmirrord_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cmirrord_var_run_t type, if you want to store the cmirrord files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
