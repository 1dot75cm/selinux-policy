.SH "NAME"
calamaris_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the calamaris processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the calamaris processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux calamaris policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their calamaris processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for calamaris:


.EX
.B calamaris_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the calamaris_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the calamaris_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B calamaris_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the calamaris_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as calamaris log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B calamaris_www_t 
.EE

- Set files with the calamaris_www_t type, if you want to treat the files as calamaris www data.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.
