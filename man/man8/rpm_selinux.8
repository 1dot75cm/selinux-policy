.SH "NAME"
rpm_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the rpm processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the rpm processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.PP
If you want to allow users to login using a sssd serve for the rpm_script_t, rpm_t, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean.

.EX
setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos for the rpm_script_t, rpm_t, you must turn on the allow_kerberos boolean.

.EX
setsebool -P allow_kerberos 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow system to run with NI for the rpm_script_t, rpm_t, you must turn on the allow_ypbind boolean.

.EX
setsebool -P allow_ypbind 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux rpm policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their rpm processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for rpm:


.EX
.PP
.B rpm_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rpm_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the rpm_t domain.

.EX
.PP
.B rpm_file_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rpm_file_t type, if you want to treat the files as rpm content.


.EX
.PP
.B rpm_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rpm_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as rpm log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.PP
.B rpm_script_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rpm_script_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the rpm_script_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B rpm_script_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rpm_script_tmp_t type, if you want to store rpm script temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B rpm_script_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rpm_script_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store rpm script files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.PP
.B rpm_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rpm_tmp_t type, if you want to store rpm temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B rpm_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rpm_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store rpm files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.PP
.B rpm_var_cache_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rpm_var_cache_t type, if you want to store the files under the /var/cache directory.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/var/cache/PackageKit(/.*)?, /var/cache/yum(/.*)?, /var/spool/up2date(/.*)?

.EX
.PP
.B rpm_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rpm_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the rpm files under the /var/lib directory.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/var/lib/yum(/.*)?, /var/lib/rpm(/.*)?, /var/lib/alternatives(/.*)?

.EX
.PP
.B rpm_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rpm_var_run_t type, if you want to store the rpm files under the /run directory.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/var/run/PackageKit(/.*)?, /var/run/yum.*

.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. 
SELinux rpm policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their rpm processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following process types are defined for rpm:

.EX
.B rpm_t, rpm_script_t 
.EE
.PP
Note: 
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE 
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
