.SH "NAME"
pingd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the pingd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the pingd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux pingd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their pingd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for pingd:


.EX
.B pingd_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the pingd_etc_t context, if you want to store pingd files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.B pingd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the pingd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the pingd_t domain.


.EX
.B pingd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the pingd_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the pingd_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B pingd_modules_t 
.EE

- Set files with the pingd_modules_t context, if you want to treat the files as pingd modules.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  pingd policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run pingd with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to control users use of ping and traceroute, you must turn on the user_ping boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P user_ping 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
