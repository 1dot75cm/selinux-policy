.SH "NAME"
pingd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the pingd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the pingd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  pingd policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run pingd with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to control users use of ping and tracerout, you must turn on the user_ping boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P user_ping 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux pingd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their pingd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for pingd:


.EX
.B pingd_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the pingd_etc_t type, if you want to store pingd files in the /etc directories.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B pingd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the pingd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the pingd_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B pingd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the pingd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the pingd_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B pingd_modules_t 
.EE

- Set files with the pingd_modules_t type, if you want to treat the files as pingd modules.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux pingd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their pingd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for pingd:
.EX

.B pingd_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 9125
.EE
.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
