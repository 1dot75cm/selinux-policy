.SH "NAME"
fail2ban_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the fail2ban processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the fail2ban processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux fail2ban policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their fail2ban processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for fail2ban:


.EX
.B fail2ban_client_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the fail2ban_client_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the fail2ban_client_t domain.


.EX
.B fail2ban_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the fail2ban_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the fail2ban_t domain.


.EX
.B fail2ban_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the fail2ban_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the fail2ban_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B fail2ban_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the fail2ban_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as fail2ban log data, usually stored in /var/log.


.EX
.B fail2ban_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the fail2ban_tmp_t context, if you want to store fail2ban temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B fail2ban_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the fail2ban_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the fail2ban files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.B fail2ban_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the fail2ban_var_run_t context, if you want to store the fail2ban files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
