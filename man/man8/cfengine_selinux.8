.SH "NAME"
cfengine_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the cfengine processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the cfengine processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux cfengine policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their cfengine processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for cfengine:


.EX
.B cfengine_execd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cfengine_execd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the cfengine_execd_t domain.


.EX
.B cfengine_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cfengine_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the cfengine_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B cfengine_monitord_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cfengine_monitord_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the cfengine_monitord_t domain.


.EX
.B cfengine_serverd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cfengine_serverd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the cfengine_serverd_t domain.


.EX
.B cfengine_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cfengine_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the cfengine files under the /var/lib directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
