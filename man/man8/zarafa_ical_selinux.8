.SH "NAME"
zarafa_ical_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the zarafa_ical processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the zarafa_ical processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The zarafa_ical processes execute with the zarafa_ical_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep zarafa_ical_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The zarafa_ical_t SELinux type can be entered via the "zarafa_ical_exec_t" file type.  The default entrypoint paths for the zarafa_ical_t domain are the following:"

/usr/bin/zarafa-ical
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux zarafa_ical policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their zarafa_ical processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for zarafa_ical:

.EX
.B zarafa_ical_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux zarafa_ical policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their zarafa_ical processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following file types are defined for zarafa_ical:


.EX
.PP
.B zarafa_ical_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the zarafa_ical_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the zarafa_ical_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B zarafa_ical_log_t
.EE

- Set files with the zarafa_ical_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as zarafa ical log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.PP
.B zarafa_ical_var_run_t
.EE

- Set files with the zarafa_ical_var_run_t type, if you want to store the zarafa ical files under the /run directory.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type zarafa_ical_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B zarafa_ical_log_t

	/var/log/zarafa/ical\.log.*
.br

.br
.B zarafa_ical_var_run_t

	/var/run/zarafa-ical\.pid
.br

.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.PP
If you want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd serve for the zarafa_ical_t, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos for the zarafa_ical_t, you must turn on the kerberos_enabled boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P kerberos_enabled 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.PP
.B system-config-selinux
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
