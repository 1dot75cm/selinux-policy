.SH "NAME"
gconfd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the gconfd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the gconfd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux gconfd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their gconfd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for gconfd:


.EX
.B gconfd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the gconfd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the gconfd_t domain.


.EX
.B gconfdefaultsm_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the gconfdefaultsm_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the gconfdefaultsm_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/usr/libexec/gconf-defaults-mechanism
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
