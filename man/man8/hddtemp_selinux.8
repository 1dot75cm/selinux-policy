.SH "NAME"
hddtemp_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the hddtemp processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the hddtemp processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux hddtemp policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their hddtemp processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for hddtemp:


.EX
.B hddtemp_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the hddtemp_etc_t type, if you want to store hddtemp files in the /etc directories.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B hddtemp_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the hddtemp_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the hddtemp_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B hddtemp_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the hddtemp_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the hddtemp_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux hddtemp policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their hddtemp processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for hddtemp:
.EX

.B hddtemp_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 7634
.EE
.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
