.SH "NAME"
hddtemp_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the hddtemp processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the hddtemp processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux hddtemp policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their hddtemp processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for hddtemp:


.EX
.B hddtemp_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the hddtemp_etc_t context, if you want to store hddtemp files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.B hddtemp_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the hddtemp_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the hddtemp_t domain.


.EX
.B hddtemp_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the hddtemp_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the hddtemp_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
