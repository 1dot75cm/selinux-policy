.SH "NAME"
cvs_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the cvs processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the cvs processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The cvs processes execute with the cvs_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep cvs_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The cvs_t SELinux type can be entered via the "cvs_exec_t" file type.  The default entrypoint paths for the cvs_t domain are the following:"

/usr/bin/cvs
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux cvs policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their cvs processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for cvs:

.EX
.B cvs_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  cvs policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run cvs with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow cvs daemon to read shadow, you must turn on the cvs_read_shadow boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P cvs_read_shadow 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow cvs daemon to read shadow, you must turn on the cvs_read_shadow boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P cvs_read_shadow 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux cvs policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their cvs processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following file types are defined for cvs:


.EX
.PP
.B cvs_data_t
.EE

- Set files with the cvs_data_t type, if you want to treat the files as cvs content.


.EX
.PP
.B cvs_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the cvs_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the cvs_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B cvs_initrc_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the cvs_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the cvs_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B cvs_keytab_t
.EE

- Set files with the cvs_keytab_t type, if you want to treat the files as kerberos keytab files.


.EX
.PP
.B cvs_tmp_t
.EE

- Set files with the cvs_tmp_t type, if you want to store cvs temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B cvs_var_run_t
.EE

- Set files with the cvs_var_run_t type, if you want to store the cvs files under the /run directory.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports.
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command:

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports.
SELinux cvs policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their cvs processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following port types are defined for cvs:

.EX
.TP 5
.B cvs_port_t
.TP 10
.EE


Default Defined Ports:
tcp 2401
.EE
udp 2401
.EE
.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type cvs_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B cvs_data_t

	/opt/cvs(/.*)?
.br
	/var/cvs(/.*)?
.br

.br
.B cvs_tmp_t


.br

.br
.B faillog_t

	/var/log/btmp.*

.br
	/var/run/pcscd\.pub
.br
	/var/run/pcscd\.comm
.br

.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.PP
If you want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd serve for the cvs_t, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos for the cvs_t, you must turn on the kerberos_enabled boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P kerberos_enabled 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage port
can also be used to manipulate the port definitions

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
