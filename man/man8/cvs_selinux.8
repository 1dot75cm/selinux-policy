.SH "NAME"
cvs_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the cvs processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the cvs processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  cvs policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run cvs with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow cvs daemon to read shado, you must turn on the allow_cvs_read_shadow boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P allow_cvs_read_shadow 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux cvs policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their cvs processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for cvs:


.EX
.B cvs_data_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cvs_data_t type, if you want to treat the files as cvs content.

.br
Paths: 
/opt/cvs(/.*)?, /var/cvs(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B cvs_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cvs_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the cvs_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B cvs_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cvs_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the cvs_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B cvs_keytab_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cvs_keytab_t type, if you want to treat the files as kerberos keytab files.


.EX
.B cvs_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cvs_tmp_t type, if you want to store cvs temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B cvs_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cvs_var_run_t type, if you want to store the cvs files under the /run directory.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux cvs policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their cvs processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for cvs:
.EX

.B cvs_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 2401
.EE
.B udp 2401
.EE
.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
