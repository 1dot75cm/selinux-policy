.SH "NAME"
gssd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the gssd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the gssd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux gssd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their gssd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for gssd:


.EX
.B gssd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the gssd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the gssd_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/rpc\.gssd, /usr/sbin/rpc\.svcgssd

.EX
.B gssd_keytab_t 
.EE

- Set files with the gssd_keytab_t context, if you want to treat the files as kerberos keytab files.


.EX
.B gssd_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the gssd_tmp_t context, if you want to store gssd temporary files in the /tmp directories.

.br
Path: 
/var/tmp/nfs_0
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  gssd policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run gssd with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow gssd to read temp directory.  For access to kerberos tgt, you must turn on the allow_gssd_read_tmp boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P allow_gssd_read_tmp 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
