.SH "NAME"
puppet_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the puppet processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the puppet processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The puppet processes execute with the puppet_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep puppet_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The puppet_t SELinux type can be entered via the \fBpuppet_exec_t\fP file type.

The default entrypoint paths for the puppet_t domain are the following:

/usr/sbin/puppetd
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux puppet policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their puppet processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for puppet:

.EX
.B puppet_t, puppetmaster_t, puppetca_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a puppet_t
can be used to make the process type puppet_t permissive. SELinux does not deny access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  puppet policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run puppet with the tightest access possible.

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type puppet_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux puppet policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their puppet processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP

.PP
.B STANDARD FILE CONTEXT

SELinux defines the file context types for the puppet, if you wanted to
store files with these types in a diffent paths, you need to execute the semanage command to sepecify alternate labeling and then use restorecon to put the labels on disk.

.B semanage fcontext -a -t puppet_etc_t '/srv/puppet/content(/.*)?'
.br
.B restorecon -R -v /srv/mypuppet_content

Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify labels that match multiple files.

.I The following file types are defined for puppet:


.EX
.PP
.B puppet_etc_t
.EE

- Set files with the puppet_etc_t type, if you want to store puppet files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.PP
.B puppet_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the puppet_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the puppet_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B puppet_initrc_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the puppet_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the puppet_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B puppet_log_t
.EE

- Set files with the puppet_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as puppet log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.PP
.B puppet_tmp_t
.EE

- Set files with the puppet_tmp_t type, if you want to store puppet temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B puppet_var_lib_t
.EE

- Set files with the puppet_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the puppet files under the /var/lib directory.

.EE

- Set files with the puppetca_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the puppetca_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B puppetmaster_exec_t
.EE

.EX
.PP
.B puppetmaster_initrc_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the puppetmaster_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the puppetmaster_initrc_t domain.

.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage port
can also be used to manipulate the port definitions

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
