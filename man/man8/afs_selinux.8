.SH "NAME"
afs_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the afs processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the afs processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux afs policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their afs processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for afs:


.EX
.B afs_bosserver_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the afs_bosserver_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the afs_bosserver_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B afs_cache_t 
.EE

- Set files with the afs_cache_t type, if you want to store the files under the /var/cache directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/cache/afs(/.*)?, /usr/vice/cache(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B afs_config_t 
.EE

- Set files with the afs_config_t type, if you want to treat the files as afs configuration data, usually stored under the /etc directory.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/afs/local(/.*)?, /usr/afs/etc(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B afs_dbdir_t 
.EE

- Set files with the afs_dbdir_t type, if you want to treat the files as afs dbdir data.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the

.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/vice/etc/afsd, /usr/sbin/afsd
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the

command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B afs_files_t 
.EE

- Set files with the afs_files_t type, if you want to treat the files as afs content.

.br
Paths: 
/vicepc, /vicepb, /vicepa
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the

command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.B afs_fsserver_exec_t 
.EE

.br
Paths: 
/usr/afs/bin/volserver, /usr/afs/bin/fileserver, /usr/afs/bin/salvager
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B afs_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux afs policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their afs processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for afs:
