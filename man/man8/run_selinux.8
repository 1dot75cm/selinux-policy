.SH "NAME"
run_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the run processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the run processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux run policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their run processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for run:


.EX
.B run_init_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the run_init_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the run_init_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  run policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run run with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow xend to run qemu-dm. Not required if using paravirt and no vfb, you must turn on the xend_run_qemu boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P xend_run_qemu 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow xend to run blktapctrl/tapdisk. Not required if using dedicated logical volumes for disk images, you must turn on the xend_run_blktap boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P xend_run_blktap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow samba to run unconfined script, you must turn on the samba_run_unconfined boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P samba_run_unconfined 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
