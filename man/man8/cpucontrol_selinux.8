.SH "NAME"
cpucontrol_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the cpucontrol processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the cpucontrol processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux cpucontrol policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their cpucontrol processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for cpucontrol:


.EX
.B cpucontrol_conf_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cpucontrol_conf_t context, if you want to treat the files as cpucontrol configuration data, usually stored under the /etc directory.

.br
Path: 
/etc/firmware/.*

.EX
.B cpucontrol_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cpucontrol_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the cpucontrol_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/sbin/microcode_ctl, /usr/sbin/microcode_ctl
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
