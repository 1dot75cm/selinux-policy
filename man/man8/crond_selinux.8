.SH "NAME"
crond_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the crond processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the crond processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux crond policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their crond processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for crond:


.EX
.B crond_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the crond_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the crond_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/atd, /usr/sbin/fcron, /usr/sbin/cron(d)?

.EX
.B crond_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the crond_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the crond_initrc_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/atd

.EX
.B crond_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the crond_tmp_t context, if you want to store crond temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B crond_unit_file_t 
.EE

- Set files with the crond_unit_file_t context, if you want to treat the files as crond unit content.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/lib/systemd/system/crond\.service, /lib/systemd/system/crond\.service

.EX
.B crond_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the crond_var_run_t context, if you want to store the crond files under the /run directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/run/crond?\.pid, /var/run/.*cron.*, /var/run/fcron\.pid, /var/run/crond?\.reboot, /var/run/fcron\.fifo, /var/run/atd\.pid, /var/run/anacron\.pid
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  crond policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run crond with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to enable extra rules in the cron domain to support fcron, you must turn on the fcron_crond boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P fcron_crond 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow system cron jobs to relabel filesystem for restoring file contexts, you must turn on the cron_can_relabel boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P cron_can_relabel 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
