.SH "NAME"
blktap_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the blktap processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the blktap processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux blktap policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their blktap processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for blktap:


.EX
.B blktap_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the blktap_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the blktap_t domain.


.EX
.B blktap_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the blktap_var_run_t context, if you want to store the blktap files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  blktap policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run blktap with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow xend to run blktapctrl/tapdisk. Not required if using dedicated logical volumes for disk images, you must turn on the xend_run_blktap boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P xend_run_blktap 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
