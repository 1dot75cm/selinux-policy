.SH "NAME"
ksmtuned_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the ksmtuned processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the ksmtuned processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux ksmtuned policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ksmtuned processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for ksmtuned:


.EX
.B ksmtuned_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ksmtuned_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the ksmtuned_t domain.


.EX
.B ksmtuned_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ksmtuned_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the ksmtuned_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B ksmtuned_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ksmtuned_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as ksmtuned log data, usually stored in /var/log.


.EX
.B ksmtuned_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ksmtuned_var_run_t context, if you want to store the ksmtuned files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
