.SH "NAME"
guest_u \- \fBLeast privledge terminal user role\fP - Security Enhanced Linux Policy

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBguest_u\fP is an SELinux User defined in the SELinux
policy. SELinux users have default roles, \fBguest_r\fP.  The
default role has a default type, \fBguest_t\fP, associated with it.

The SELinux user will usually login to a system with a context that looks like:

.B guest_u:guest_r:guest_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023

Linux users are automatically assigned an SELinux users at login.
Login programs use the SELinux User to assign initial context to the user's shell.

SELinux policy uses the context to control the user's access.

By default all users are assigned to the SELinux user via the \fB__default__\fP flag

On Targeted policy systems the \fB__default__\fP user is assigned to the \fBunconfined_u\fP SELinux user.

You can list all Linux User to SELinux user mapping using:

.B semanage login -l

If you wanted to change the default user mapping to use the guest_u user, you would execute:

.B semanage login -m -s guest_u __default__


If you want to map the one Linux user (joe) to the SELinux user guest, you would execute:

.B $ semanage login -a -s guest_u joe


.SH USER DESCRIPTION

The SELinux user guest_u is defined in policy as a unprivileged user. SELinux prevents unprivileged users from doing administration tasks without transitioning to a different role.

.SH SUDO

.SH X WINDOWS LOGIN

The SELinux user guest_u is not able to X Windows login.

.SH NETWORK

.TP
The SELinux user guest_u is able to connect to the following tcp ports.

.B dns_port_t: 53

.B ocsp_port_t: 9080

.B kerberos_port_t: 88,750,4444

.TP
The SELinux user guest_u is able to connect to the following tcp ports.

.B dns_port_t: 53

.B ocsp_port_t: 9080

.B kerberos_port_t: 88,750,4444

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  guest policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run guest with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow xguest users to mount removable media, you must turn on the xguest_mount_media boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P xguest_mount_media 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow xguest users to configure Network Manager and connect to apache ports, you must turn on the xguest_connect_network boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P xguest_connect_network 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow xguest to use blue tooth devices, you must turn on the xguest_use_bluetooth boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P xguest_use_bluetooth 1

.SH HOME_EXEC

The SELinux user guest_u is able execute home content files.

.SH TRANSITIONS

Three things can happen when guest_t attempts to execute a program.

\fB1.\fP SELinux Policy can deny guest_t from executing the program.

.TP

\fB2.\fP SELinux Policy can allow guest_t to execute the program in the current user type.

Execute the following to see the types that the SELinux user guest_t can execute without transitioning:

.B search -A -s guest_t -c file -p execute_no_trans

.TP

\fB3.\fP SELinux can allow guest_t to execute the program and transition to a new type.

Execute the following to see the types that the SELinux user guest_t can execute and transition:

.B $ search -A -s guest_t -c process -p transition


.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type guest_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.
