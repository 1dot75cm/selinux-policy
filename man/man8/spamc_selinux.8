.SH "NAME"
spamc_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the spamc processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the spamc processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux spamc policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their spamc processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for spamc:


.EX
.B spamc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the spamc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the spamc_t domain.


.EX
.B spamc_home_t 
.EE

- Set files with the spamc_home_t context, if you want to store spamc files in the users home directory.


.EX
.B spamc_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the spamc_tmp_t context, if you want to store spamc temporary files in the /tmp directories.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
