.SH "NAME"
spamc_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the spamc processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the spamc processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux spamc policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their spamc processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for spamc:


.EX
.B spamc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the spamc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the spamc_t domain.


.EX
.B spamc_home_t 
.EE

- Set files with the spamc_home_t context, if you want to store spamc files in the users home directory.


.EX
.B spamc_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the spamc_tmp_t context, if you want to store spamc temporary files in the /tmp directories.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  spamc policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run spamc with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow user spamassassin clients to use the network, you must turn on the spamassassin_can_network boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P spamassassin_can_network 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow spamd to read/write user home directories, you must turn on the spamd_enable_home_dirs boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P spamd_enable_home_dirs 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow http daemon to check spa, you must turn on the httpd_can_check_spam boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P httpd_can_check_spam 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
