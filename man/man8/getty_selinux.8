.SH "NAME"
getty_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the getty processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the getty processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux getty policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their getty processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for getty:


.EX
.B getty_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the getty_etc_t type, if you want to store getty files in the /etc directories.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B getty_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the getty_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the getty_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/.*getty, /sbin/.*getty
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B getty_lock_t 
.EE

- Set files with the getty_lock_t type, if you want to treat the files as getty lock data, stored under the /var/lock directory


.EX
.B getty_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the getty_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as getty log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/log/mgetty\.log.*, /var/log/vgetty\.log\..*
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B getty_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the getty_tmp_t type, if you want to store getty temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B getty_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the getty_var_run_t type, if you want to store the getty files under the /run directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/spool/voice(/.*)?, /var/spool/fax(/.*)?, /var/run/mgetty\.pid.*
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
