.SH "NAME"
getty_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the getty processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the getty processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux getty policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their getty processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for getty:


.EX
.B getty_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the getty_etc_t context, if you want to store getty files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.B getty_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the getty_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the getty_t domain.


.EX
.B getty_lock_t 
.EE

- Set files with the getty_lock_t context, if you want to treat the files as getty lock data, stored under the /var/lock directory


.EX
.B getty_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the getty_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as getty log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.B getty_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the getty_tmp_t context, if you want to store getty temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B getty_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the getty_var_run_t context, if you want to store the getty files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux
