.SH "NAME"
openshift_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the openshift processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the openshift processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The openshift processes execute with the openshift_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep openshift_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The openshift_t SELinux type can be entered via the \fBopenshift_file_type, shell_exec_t, httpd_exec_t, user_cron_spool_t, gpg_exec_t, bin_t\fP file types.

The default entrypoint paths for the openshift_t domain are the following:

All executeables with the default executable label, usually stored in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin.
/bin/d?ash, /bin/zsh.*, /bin/ksh.*, /usr/bin/d?ash, /usr/bin/ksh.*, /usr/bin/zsh.*, /bin/esh, /bin/mksh, /bin/sash, /bin/tcsh, /bin/yash, /bin/bash, /bin/fish, /bin/bash2, /usr/bin/esh, /usr/bin/fish, /usr/bin/bash, /usr/bin/mksh, /usr/bin/sash, /usr/bin/tcsh, /usr/bin/yash, /sbin/nologin, /usr/sbin/sesh, /usr/bin/bash2, /usr/sbin/smrsh, /usr/bin/scponly, /usr/sbin/nologin, /usr/libexec/sesh, /usr/sbin/scponlyc, /usr/bin/git-shell, /usr/libexec/git-core/git-shell, /usr/sbin/httpd(\.worker)?, /usr/sbin/apache(2)?, /usr/lib/apache-ssl/.+, /usr/sbin/apache-ssl(2)?, /usr/share/jetty/bin/jetty.sh, /usr/sbin/php-fpm, /usr/sbin/cherokee, /usr/sbin/lighttpd, /usr/sbin/httpd\.event, /usr/bin/mongrel_rails, /var/spool/at(/.*)?, /var/spool/cron, /usr/bin/gpg(2)?, /usr/lib/gnupg/.*, /usr/bin/gpgsm
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux openshift policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their openshift processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for openshift:

.EX
.B openshift_app_t, openshift_min_t, openshift_net_t, openshift_min_app_t, openshift_net_app_t, openshift_cgroup_read_t, openshift_initrc_t, openshift_mail_t, openshift_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a openshift_t
can be used to make the process type openshift_t permissive. SELinux does not deny access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  openshift policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run openshift with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd server, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean. Disabled by default.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports.
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command:

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports.
SELinux openshift policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their openshift processes in as secure a method as possible.

.TP 10
.EE

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type openshift_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux openshift policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their openshift processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP

.PP
.B EQUIVALENCE DIRECTORIES

.PP
openshift policy stores data with multiple different file context types under the /var/lib/openshift directory.  If you would like to store the data in a different directory you can use the semanage command to create an equivalence mapping.  If you wanted to store this data under the /srv dirctory you would execute the following command:
.PP
.B semanage fcontext -a -e /var/lib/openshift /srv/openshift
.br
.B restorecon -R -v /srv/openshift
.PP

.PP
openshift policy stores data with multiple different file context types under the /var/lib/stickshift directory.  If you would like to store the data in a different directory you can use the semanage command to create an equivalence mapping.  If you wanted to store this data under the /srv dirctory you would execute the following command:
.PP
.B semanage fcontext -a -e /var/lib/stickshift /srv/stickshift
.br
.B restorecon -R -v /srv/stickshift
.PP

.PP
.B STANDARD FILE CONTEXT

SELinux defines the file context types for the openshift, if you wanted to
store files with these types in a diffent paths, you need to execute the semanage command to sepecify alternate labeling and then use restorecon to put the labels on disk.

.B semanage fcontext -a -t openshift_cgroup_read_exec_t '/srv/openshift/content(/.*)?'
.br
.B restorecon -R -v /srv/myopenshift_content

Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify labels that match multiple files.

.I The following file types are defined for openshift:


.EX

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage port
can also be used to manipulate the port definitions

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
