.SH "NAME"
rssh_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the rssh processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the rssh processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux rssh policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their rssh processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for rssh:


.EX
.B rssh_chroot_helper_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rssh_chroot_helper_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the rssh_chroot_helper_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/usr/libexec/rssh_chroot_helper

.EX
.B rssh_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rssh_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the rssh_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/usr/bin/rssh

.EX
.B rssh_ro_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rssh_ro_t context, if you want to treat the files as rssh read/only content.


.EX
.B rssh_rw_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rssh_rw_t context, if you want to treat the files as rssh read/write content.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
