.SH "NAME"
shorewall_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the shorewall processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the shorewall processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux shorewall policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their shorewall processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for shorewall:


.EX
.B shorewall_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the shorewall_etc_t context, if you want to store shorewall files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.B shorewall_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the shorewall_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the shorewall_t domain.


.EX
.B shorewall_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the shorewall_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the shorewall_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B shorewall_lock_t 
.EE

- Set files with the shorewall_lock_t context, if you want to treat the files as shorewall lock data, stored under the /var/lock directory


.EX
.B shorewall_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the shorewall_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as shorewall log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.B shorewall_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the shorewall_tmp_t context, if you want to store shorewall temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B shorewall_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the shorewall_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the shorewall files under the /var/lib directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
