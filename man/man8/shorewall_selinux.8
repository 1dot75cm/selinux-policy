.SH "NAME"
shorewall_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the shorewall processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"


SELinux Linux secures
.B shorewall
(Shoreline Firewall high-level tool for configuring netfilter)
processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  



.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux shorewall policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their shorewall processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for shorewall:


.EX
.PP
.B shorewall_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the shorewall_etc_t type, if you want to store shorewall files in the /etc directories.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/etc/shorewall-lite(/.*)?, /etc/shorewall(/.*)?

.EX
.PP
.B shorewall_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the shorewall_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the shorewall_t domain.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/sbin/shorewall6?, /sbin/shorewall-lite, /usr/sbin/shorewall-lite, /usr/sbin/shorewall6?

.EX
.PP
.B shorewall_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the shorewall_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the shorewall_initrc_t domain.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/shorewall, /etc/rc\.d/init\.d/shorewall-lite

.EX
.PP
.B shorewall_lock_t 
.EE

- Set files with the shorewall_lock_t type, if you want to treat the files as shorewall lock data, stored under the /var/lock directory


.EX
.PP
.B shorewall_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the shorewall_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as shorewall log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.PP
.B shorewall_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the shorewall_tmp_t type, if you want to store shorewall temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B shorewall_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the shorewall_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the shorewall files under the /var/lib directory.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/var/lib/shorewall-lite(/.*)?, /var/lib/shorewall(/.*)?, /var/lib/shorewall6(/.*)?

.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. 
SELinux shorewall policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their shorewall processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following process types are defined for shorewall:

.EX
.B shorewall_t 
.EE
.PP
Note: 
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE 
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
