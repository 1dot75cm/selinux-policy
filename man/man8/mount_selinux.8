.SH "NAME"
mount_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the mount processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the mount processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The mount processes execute with the mount_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep mount_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The mount_t SELinux type can be entered via the \fBmount_exec_t, fusermount_exec_t\fP file types.

The default entrypoint paths for the mount_t domain are the following:

/bin/mount.*, /bin/umount.*, /sbin/mount.*, /sbin/umount.*, /usr/bin/mount.*, /usr/bin/umount.*, /usr/sbin/mount.*, /usr/sbin/umount.*, /bin/fusermount, /usr/bin/fusermount
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux mount policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their mount processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for mount:

.EX
.B mount_t, mount_ecryptfs_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a mount_t
can be used to make the process type mount_t permissive. SELinux does not deny access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  mount policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run mount with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow the mount command to mount any directory or file, you must turn on the mount_anyfile boolean. Enabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P mount_anyfile 1

.EX
.B setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos for the mount_t, mount_ecryptfs_t, you must turn on the kerberos_enabled boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P kerberos_enabled 1
.EE

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports.
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command:

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports.
SELinux mount policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their mount processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following port types are defined for mount:

.EX
.TP 5
.B mountd_port_t
.TP 10
.EE


Default Defined Ports:
tcp 20048
.EE
udp 20048
.EE
.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type mount_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux mount policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their mount processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP

.PP
.B STANDARD FILE CONTEXT

SELinux defines the file context types for the mount, if you wanted to
store files with these types in a diffent paths, you need to execute the semanage command to sepecify alternate labeling and then use restorecon to put the labels on disk.

.B semanage fcontext -a -t mount_ecryptfs_exec_t '/srv/mount/content(/.*)?'
.br
.B restorecon -R -v /srv/mymount_content

Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify labels that match multiple files.

.I The following file types are defined for mount:


.EX
.PP
.B mount_ecryptfs_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the mount_ecryptfs_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the mount_ecryptfs_t domain.

.br
.TP 5
Paths:
/usr/sbin/mount\.ecryptfs, /usr/sbin/umount\.ecryptfs, /usr/sbin/mount\.ecryptfs_private, /usr/sbin/umount\.ecryptfs_private

.EX
.PP
.B mount_ecryptfs_tmpfs_t
.EE

- Set files with the mount_ecryptfs_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store mount ecryptfs files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.PP
.B mount_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the mount_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the mount_t domain.

.br
.TP 5
Paths:
/bin/mount.*, /bin/umount.*, /sbin/mount.*, /sbin/umount.*, /usr/bin/mount.*, /usr/bin/umount.*, /usr/sbin/mount.*, /usr/sbin/umount.*

.EX
.PP
.B mount_loopback_t
.EE

- Set files with the mount_loopback_t type, if you want to treat the files as mount loopback data.


.EX
.PP
.B mount_tmp_t
.EE

- Set files with the mount_tmp_t type, if you want to store mount temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B mount_var_run_t
.EE

- Set files with the mount_var_run_t type, if you want to store the mount files under the /run or /var/run directory.

.br
.TP 5
Paths:
/run/mount(/.*)?, /dev/\.mount(/.*)?, /var/run/mount(/.*)?, /var/run/davfs2(/.*)?, /var/cache/davfs2(/.*)?

.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage port
can also be used to manipulate the port definitions

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans
