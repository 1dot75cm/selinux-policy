.SH "NAME"
mount_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the mount processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the mount processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux mount policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their mount processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for mount:


.EX
.B mount_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mount_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the mount_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/sbin/mount.*, /sbin/umount.*, /usr/bin/umount.*, /usr/sbin/umount.*, /bin/umount.*, /usr/bin/mount.*, /bin/mount.*, /usr/sbin/mount.*

.EX
.B mount_loopback_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mount_loopback_t context, if you want to treat the files as mount loopback data.


.EX
.B mount_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mount_tmp_t context, if you want to store mount temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B mount_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mount_var_run_t context, if you want to store the mount files under the /run directory.

.br
Paths: 
/run/mount(/.*)?, /dev/\.mount(/.*)?, /var/run/mount(/.*)?, /var/run/davfs2(/.*)?, /var/cache/davfs2(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  mount policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run mount with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow the mount command to mount any directory or file, you must turn on the allow_mount_anyfile boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P allow_mount_anyfile 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow xguest users to mount removable medi, you must turn on the xguest_mount_media boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P xguest_mount_media 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
