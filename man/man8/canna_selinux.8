.SH "NAME"
canna_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the canna processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the canna processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux canna policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their canna processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for canna:


.EX
.B canna_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the canna_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the canna_t domain.


.EX
.B canna_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the canna_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the canna_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B canna_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the canna_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as canna log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.B canna_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the canna_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the canna files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.B canna_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the canna_var_run_t context, if you want to store the canna files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
