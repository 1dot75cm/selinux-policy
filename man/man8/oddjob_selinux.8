.SH "NAME"
oddjob_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the oddjob processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the oddjob processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux oddjob policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their oddjob processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for oddjob:


.EX
.B oddjob_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the oddjob_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the oddjob_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B oddjob_mkhomedir_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the oddjob_mkhomedir_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the oddjob_mkhomedir_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/libexec/oddjob/mkhomedir, /usr/lib/oddjob/mkhomedir
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B oddjob_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the oddjob_var_run_t type, if you want to store the oddjob files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
