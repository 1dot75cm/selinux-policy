.SH "NAME"
spamass_milter_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the spamass_milter processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the spamass_milter processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The spamass_milter processes execute with the spamass_milter_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep spamass_milter_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The spamass_milter_t SELinux type can be entered via the \fBspamass_milter_exec_t\fP file type.

The default entrypoint paths for the spamass_milter_t domain are the following:

/usr/sbin/spamass-milter
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux spamass_milter policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their spamass_milter processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for spamass_milter:

.EX
.B spamass_milter_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a spamass_milter_t
can be used to make the process type spamass_milter_t permissive. SELinux does not deny access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  spamass_milter policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run spamass_milter with the tightest access possible.

.EE

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type spamass_milter_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B root_t

	/
.br
	/initrd
.br

.br
.B spamass_milter_data_t

	/var/run/spamass(/.*)?
.br
	/var/run/spamass-milter(/.*)?
.br
	/var/spool/postfix/spamass(/.*)?
.br
	/var/run/spamass-milter\.pid
.br

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux spamass_milter policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their spamass_milter processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP

.PP
.B EQUIVALENCE DIRECTORIES

.PP
spamass_milter policy stores data with multiple different file context types under the /var/run/spamass directory.  If you would like to store the data in a different directory you can use the semanage command to create an equivalence mapping.  If you wanted to store this data under the /srv dirctory you would execute the following command:
.PP
.B semanage fcontext -a -e /var/run/spamass /srv/spamass
.br
.B restorecon -R -v /srv/spamass
.PP

.PP
.B STANDARD FILE CONTEXT

SELinux defines the file context types for the spamass_milter, if you wanted to
store files with these types in a diffent paths, you need to execute the semanage command to sepecify alternate labeling and then use restorecon to put the labels on disk.

.B semanage fcontext -a -t spamass_milter_data_t '/srv/spamass_milter/content(/.*)?'
.br
.B restorecon -R -v /srv/myspamass_milter_content

Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify labels that match multiple files.

.I The following file types are defined for spamass_milter:


.EX
.PP
.B spamass_milter_data_t
.EE

- Set files with the spamass_milter_data_t type, if you want to treat the files as spamass milter content.

.br
.TP 5
Paths:
/var/run/spamass(/.*)?, /var/run/spamass-milter(/.*)?, /var/spool/postfix/spamass(/.*)?, /var/run/spamass-milter\.pid

.EX
.PP
.B spamass_milter_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the spamass_milter_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the spamass_milter_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B spamass_milter_state_t
.EE

- Set files with the spamass_milter_state_t type, if you want to treat the files as spamass milter state data.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
