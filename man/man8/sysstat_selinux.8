.SH "NAME"
sysstat_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the sysstat processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the sysstat processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux sysstat policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their sysstat processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for sysstat:


.EX
.B sysstat_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the sysstat_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the sysstat_t domain.


.EX
.B sysstat_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the sysstat_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as sysstat log data, usually stored in /var/log.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
