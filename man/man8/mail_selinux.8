.SH "NAME"
mail_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the mail processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the mail processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux mail policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their mail processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for mail:


.EX
.B mail_home_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mail_home_t context, if you want to store mail files in the users home directory.


.EX
.B mail_munin_plugin_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mail_munin_plugin_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the mail_munin_plugin_t domain.


.EX
.B mail_munin_plugin_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mail_munin_plugin_tmp_t context, if you want to store mail munin plugin temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B mail_spool_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mail_spool_t context, if you want to store the mail files under the /var/spool directory.


.EX
.B mailman_archive_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mailman_archive_t context, if you want to treat the files as mailman archive data.


.EX
.B mailman_cgi_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mailman_cgi_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the mailman_cgi_t domain.


.EX
.B mailman_cgi_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mailman_cgi_tmp_t context, if you want to store mailman cgi temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B mailman_data_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mailman_data_t context, if you want to treat the files as mailman content.


.EX
.B mailman_lock_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mailman_lock_t context, if you want to treat the files as mailman lock data, stored under the /var/lock directory


.EX
.B mailman_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mailman_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as mailman log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.B mailman_mail_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mailman_mail_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the mailman_mail_t domain.


.EX
.B mailman_mail_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mailman_mail_tmp_t context, if you want to store mailman mail temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B mailman_queue_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mailman_queue_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the mailman_queue_t domain.


.EX
.B mailman_queue_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mailman_queue_tmp_t context, if you want to store mailman queue temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B mailman_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mailman_var_run_t context, if you want to store the mailman files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  mail policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run mail with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow postfix_local domain full write access to mail_spool directorie, you must turn on the allow_postfix_local_write_mail_spool boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P allow_postfix_local_write_mail_spool 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow http daemon to send mai, you must turn on the httpd_can_sendmail boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P httpd_can_sendmail 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow syslogd daemon to send mai, you must turn on the logging_syslogd_can_sendmail boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P logging_syslogd_can_sendmail 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow gitisis daemon to send mai, you must turn on the gitosis_can_sendmail boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P gitosis_can_sendmail 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
