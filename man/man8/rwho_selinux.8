.SH "NAME"
rwho_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the rwho processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the rwho processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux rwho policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their rwho processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for rwho:


.EX
.B rwho_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rwho_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the rwho_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/usr/sbin/rwhod

.EX
.B rwho_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rwho_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the rwho_initrc_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/rwhod

.EX
.B rwho_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rwho_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as rwho log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/log/rwhod(/.*)?

.EX
.B rwho_spool_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rwho_spool_t context, if you want to store the rwho files under the /var/spool directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/spool/rwho(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
