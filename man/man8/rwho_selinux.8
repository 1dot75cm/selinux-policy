.SH "NAME"
rwho_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the rwho processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the rwho processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The rwho processes execute with the rwho_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier. 

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep rwho_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The rwho_t SELinux type can be entered via the "rwho_exec_t" file type.  The default entrypoint paths for the rwho_t domain are the following:"

/usr/sbin/rwhod
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. 
SELinux rwho policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their rwho processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following process types are defined for rwho:

.EX
.B rwho_t 
.EE
.PP
Note: 
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE 
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux rwho policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their rwho processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for rwho:


.EX
.PP
.B rwho_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rwho_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the rwho_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B rwho_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rwho_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the rwho_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B rwho_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rwho_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as rwho log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.PP
.B rwho_spool_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rwho_spool_t type, if you want to store the rwho files under the /var/spool directory.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux rwho policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their rwho processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for rwho:

.EX
.TP 5
.B rwho_port_t 
.TP 10
.EE


Default Defined Ports:
udp 513
.EE
.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type rwho_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B rwho_log_t

	/var/log/rwhod(/.*)?
.br

.br
.B rwho_spool_t

	/var/spool/rwho(/.*)?
.br

.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage port
can also be used to manipulate the port definitions

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
