.SH "NAME"
vmware_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the vmware processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the vmware processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The vmware processes execute with the vmware_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier. 

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep vmware_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The vmware_t SELinux type can be entered via the "vmware_exec_t" file type.  The default entrypoint paths for the vmware_t domain are the following:"

/usr/bin/vmware, /usr/bin/vmware-ping, /usr/bin/vmware-wizard, /usr/sbin/vmware-serverd, /usr/lib/vmware/bin/vmplayer, /usr/lib/vmware/bin/vmware-ui, /usr/lib/vmware/bin/vmware-mks
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. 
SELinux vmware policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their vmware processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following process types are defined for vmware:

.EX
.B vmware_t, vmware_host_t 
.EE
.PP
Note: 
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE 
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux vmware policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their vmware processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for vmware:


.EX
.PP
.B vmware_conf_t 
.EE

- Set files with the vmware_conf_t type, if you want to treat the files as vmware configuration data, usually stored under the /etc directory.


.EX
.PP
.B vmware_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the vmware_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the vmware_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B vmware_file_t 
.EE

- Set files with the vmware_file_t type, if you want to treat the files as vmware content.


.EX
.PP
.B vmware_host_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the vmware_host_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the vmware_host_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B vmware_host_pid_t 
.EE

- Set files with the vmware_host_pid_t type, if you want to store the vmware host files under the /run directory.


.EX
.PP
.B vmware_host_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the vmware_host_tmp_t type, if you want to store vmware host temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B vmware_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the vmware_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as vmware log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.PP
.B vmware_pid_t 
.EE

- Set files with the vmware_pid_t type, if you want to store the vmware files under the /run directory.


.EX
.PP
.B vmware_sys_conf_t 
.EE

- Set files with the vmware_sys_conf_t type, if you want to treat the files as vmware sys configuration data, usually stored under the /etc directory.


.EX
.PP
.B vmware_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the vmware_tmp_t type, if you want to store vmware temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B vmware_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the vmware_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store vmware files on a tmpfs file system.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type vmware_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.
