.SH "NAME"
netlabel_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the netlabel processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the netlabel processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux netlabel policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their netlabel processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for netlabel:


.EX
.B netlabel_mgmt_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the netlabel_mgmt_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the netlabel_mgmt_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
