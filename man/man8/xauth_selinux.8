.SH "NAME"
xauth_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the xauth processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the xauth processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux xauth policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their xauth processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for xauth:


.EX
.B xauth_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the xauth_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the xauth_t domain.


.EX
.B xauth_home_t 
.EE

- Set files with the xauth_home_t context, if you want to store xauth files in the users home directory.


.EX
.B xauth_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the xauth_tmp_t context, if you want to store xauth temporary files in the /tmp directories.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
