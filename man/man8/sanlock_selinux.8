.SH "NAME"
sanlock_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the sanlock processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the sanlock processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The sanlock processes execute with the sanlock_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier. 

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep sanlock_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The sanlock_t SELinux type can be entered via the "sanlock_exec_t" file type.  The default entrypoint paths for the sanlock_t domain are the following:"

/usr/sbin/sanlock
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. 
SELinux sanlock policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their sanlock processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following process types are defined for sanlock:

.EX
.B sanlock_t 
.EE
.PP
Note: 
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE 
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  sanlock policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run sanlock with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow sanlock to read/write fuse files, you must turn on the sanlock_use_fusefs boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P sanlock_use_fusefs 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow sanlock to manage cifs files, you must turn on the sanlock_use_samba boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P sanlock_use_samba 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined virtual guests to interact with the sanlock, you must turn on the virt_use_sanlock boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P virt_use_sanlock 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow sanlock to manage nfs files, you must turn on the sanlock_use_nfs boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P sanlock_use_nfs 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow sanlock to read/write fuse files, you must turn on the sanlock_use_fusefs boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P sanlock_use_fusefs 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow sanlock to manage cifs files, you must turn on the sanlock_use_samba boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P sanlock_use_samba 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined virtual guests to interact with the sanlock, you must turn on the virt_use_sanlock boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P virt_use_sanlock 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow sanlock to manage nfs files, you must turn on the sanlock_use_nfs boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P sanlock_use_nfs 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux sanlock policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their sanlock processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for sanlock:


.EX
.PP
.B sanlock_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the sanlock_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the sanlock_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B sanlock_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the sanlock_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the sanlock_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B sanlock_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the sanlock_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as sanlock log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.PP
.B sanlock_unit_file_t 
.EE

- Set files with the sanlock_unit_file_t type, if you want to treat the files as sanlock unit content.


.EX
.PP
.B sanlock_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the sanlock_var_run_t type, if you want to store the sanlock files under the /run directory.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type sanlock_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B sanlock_log_t

	/var/log/sanlock\.log.*
.br

.br
.B sanlock_var_run_t

	/var/run/sanlock(/.*)?
.br

.br
.B virt_var_lib_t

	/var/lib/oz(/.*)?
.br
	/var/lib/libvirt(/.*)?
.br

.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.PP
If you want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd serve for the sanlock_t, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos for the sanlock_t, you must turn on the kerberos_enabled boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P kerberos_enabled 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
