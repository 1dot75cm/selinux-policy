.SH "NAME"
tftpd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the tftpd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the tftpd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux tftpd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their tftpd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for tftpd:


.EX
.B tftpd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tftpd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the tftpd_t domain.


.EX
.B tftpd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tftpd_var_run_t context, if you want to store the tftpd files under the /run directory.


.EX
.B tftpdir_rw_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tftpdir_rw_t context, if you want to treat the files as tftpdir read/write content.


.EX
.B tftpdir_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tftpdir_t context, if you want to treat the files as tftpdir data.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  tftpd policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run tftpd with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow tftp to modify public files used for public file transfer services., you must turn on the tftp_anon_write boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P tftp_anon_write 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
