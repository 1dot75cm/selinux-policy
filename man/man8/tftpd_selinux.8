.SH "NAME"
tftpd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the tftpd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the tftpd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux tftpd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their tftpd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for tftpd:


.EX
.B tftpd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tftpd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the tftpd_t domain.


.EX
.B tftpd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tftpd_var_run_t context, if you want to store the tftpd files under the /run directory.


.EX
.B tftpdir_rw_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tftpdir_rw_t context, if you want to treat the files as tftpdir read/write content.


.EX
.B tftpdir_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tftpdir_t context, if you want to treat the files as tftpdir data.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH SHARING FILES
If you want to share files with multiple domains (Apache, FTP, rsync, Samba), you can set a file context of public_content_t and public_content_rw_t.  These context allow any of the above domains to read the content.  If you want a particular domain to write to the public_content_rw_t domain, you must set the appropriate boolean.
.TP
Allow tftpd servers to read the /var/tftpd directory by adding the public_content_t file type to the directory and by restoring the file type.
.PP
.B
semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_t "/var/tftpd(/.*)?"
.TP
.B
restorecon -F -R -v /var/tftpd
.pp
.TP
Allow tftpd servers to read and write /var/tmp/incoming by adding the public_content_rw_t type to the directory and by restoring the file type.  This also requires the allow_tftpdd_anon_write boolean to be set.
.PP
.B
semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_rw_t "/var/tftpd/incoming(/.*)?"
.TP
.B
restorecon -F -R -v /var/tftpd/incoming


.PP
If you want to allow tftp to modify public files used for public file transfer services., you must turn on the tftp_anon_write boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P tftp_anon_write 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
