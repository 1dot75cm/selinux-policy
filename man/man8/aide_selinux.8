.SH "NAME"
aide_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the aide processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the aide processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux aide policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their aide processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for aide:


.EX
.B aide_db_t 
.EE

- Set files with the aide_db_t context, if you want to treat the files as aide database content.

.br
Path: 
/var/lib/aide(/.*)?

.EX
.B aide_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the aide_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the aide_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/usr/sbin/aide

.EX
.B aide_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the aide_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as aide log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/log/aide\.log, /var/log/aide(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
