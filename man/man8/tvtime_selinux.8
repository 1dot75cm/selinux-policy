.SH "NAME"
tvtime_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the tvtime processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the tvtime processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux tvtime policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their tvtime processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for tvtime:


.EX
.B tvtime_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tvtime_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the tvtime_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/usr/bin/tvtime

.EX
.B tvtime_home_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tvtime_home_t context, if you want to store tvtime files in the users home directory.


.EX
.B tvtime_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tvtime_tmp_t context, if you want to store tvtime temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B tvtime_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tvtime_tmpfs_t context, if you want to store tvtime files on a tmpfs file system.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
