.SH "NAME"
tvtime_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the tvtime processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the tvtime processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The tvtime processes execute with the tvtime_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier. 

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep tvtime_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The tvtime_t SELinux type can be entered via the "tvtime_exec_t" file type.  The default entrypoint paths for the tvtime_t domain are the following:"

/usr/bin/tvtime
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. 
SELinux tvtime policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their tvtime processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following process types are defined for tvtime:

.EX
.B tvtime_t 
.EE
.PP
Note: 
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE 
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux tvtime policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their tvtime processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for tvtime:


.EX
.PP
.B tvtime_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tvtime_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the tvtime_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B tvtime_home_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tvtime_home_t type, if you want to store tvtime files in the users home directory.


.EX
.PP
.B tvtime_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tvtime_tmp_t type, if you want to store tvtime temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B tvtime_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tvtime_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store tvtime files on a tmpfs file system.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type tvtime_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.
