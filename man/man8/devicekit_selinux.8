.SH "NAME"
devicekit_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the devicekit processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the devicekit processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux devicekit policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their devicekit processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for devicekit:


.EX
.B devicekit_disk_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the devicekit_disk_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the devicekit_disk_t domain.


.EX
.B devicekit_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the devicekit_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the devicekit_t domain.


.EX
.B devicekit_power_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the devicekit_power_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the devicekit_power_t domain.


.EX
.B devicekit_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the devicekit_tmp_t context, if you want to store devicekit temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B devicekit_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the devicekit_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the devicekit files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.B devicekit_var_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the devicekit_var_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as devicekit var log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.B devicekit_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the devicekit_var_run_t context, if you want to store the devicekit files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
