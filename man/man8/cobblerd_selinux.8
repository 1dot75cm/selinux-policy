.SH "NAME"
cobblerd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the cobblerd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the cobblerd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux cobblerd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their cobblerd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for cobblerd:


.EX
.B cobblerd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cobblerd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the cobblerd_t domain.


.EX
.B cobblerd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cobblerd_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the cobblerd_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  cobblerd policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run cobblerd with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow Cobbler to connect to the network using TCP., you must turn on the cobbler_can_network_connect boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P cobbler_can_network_connect 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow Cobbler to access nfs file systems., you must turn on the cobbler_use_nfs boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P cobbler_use_nfs 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow Cobbler to modify public files used for public file transfer services., you must turn on the cobbler_anon_write boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P cobbler_anon_write 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow HTTPD scripts and modules to connect to cobbler over the network., you must turn on the httpd_can_network_connect_cobbler boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_cobbler 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow Cobbler to access cifs file systems., you must turn on the cobbler_use_cifs boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P cobbler_use_cifs 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
