.SH "NAME"
cyrus_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the cyrus processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the cyrus processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux cyrus policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their cyrus processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for cyrus:


.EX
.B cyrus_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cyrus_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the cyrus_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/lib/cyrus-imapd/cyrus-master, /usr/lib/cyrus/master

.EX
.B cyrus_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cyrus_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the cyrus_initrc_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/cyrus

.EX
.B cyrus_keytab_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cyrus_keytab_t context, if you want to treat the files as kerberos keytab files.


.EX
.B cyrus_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cyrus_tmp_t context, if you want to store cyrus temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B cyrus_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cyrus_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the cyrus files under the /var/lib directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/imap(/.*)?, /var/lib/imap(/.*)?

.EX
.B cyrus_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cyrus_var_run_t context, if you want to store the cyrus files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
