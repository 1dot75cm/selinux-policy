.SH "NAME"
puppetmaster_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the puppetmaster processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the puppetmaster processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux puppetmaster policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their puppetmaster processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for puppetmaster:


.EX
.B puppetmaster_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the puppetmaster_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the puppetmaster_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/usr/sbin/puppetmasterd

.EX
.B puppetmaster_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the puppetmaster_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the puppetmaster_initrc_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/puppetmaster

.EX
.B puppetmaster_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the puppetmaster_tmp_t context, if you want to store puppetmaster temporary files in the /tmp directories.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  puppetmaster policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run puppetmaster with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow Puppet master to use connect to MySQL and PostgreSQL databas, you must turn on the puppetmaster_use_db boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P puppetmaster_use_db 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
