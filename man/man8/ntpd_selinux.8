.SH "NAME"
ntpd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the ntpd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the ntpd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux ntpd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ntpd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for ntpd:


.EX
.B ntpd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntpd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the ntpd_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/ntpd, /etc/cron\.(daily|weekly)/ntp-server, /etc/cron\.(daily|weekly)/ntp-simple
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B ntpd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntpd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the ntpd_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B ntpd_key_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntpd_key_t type, if you want to treat the files as ntpd key data.

.br
Paths: 
/etc/ntp/crypto(/.*)?, /etc/ntp/keys
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B ntpd_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntpd_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as ntpd log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/log/ntpstats(/.*)?, /var/log/xntpd.*, /var/log/ntp.*
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B ntpd_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntpd_tmp_t type, if you want to store ntpd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B ntpd_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntpd_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store ntpd files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.B ntpd_unit_file_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntpd_unit_file_t type, if you want to treat the files as ntpd unit content.

.br
Paths: 
/lib/systemd/system/ntpd\.service, /usr/lib/systemd/system/ntpd\.service
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B ntpd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntpd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the ntpd files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B ntpdate_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntpdate_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the ntpdate_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux ntpd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ntpd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for ntpd:
.EX

.B ntp_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B udp 123
.EE
.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
