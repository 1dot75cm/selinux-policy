.SH "NAME"
ntpd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the ntpd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the ntpd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux ntpd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ntpd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for ntpd:


.EX
.B ntpd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntpd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the ntpd_t domain.


.EX
.B ntpd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntpd_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the ntpd_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B ntpd_key_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntpd_key_t context, if you want to treat the files as ntpd key data.


.EX
.B ntpd_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntpd_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as ntpd log data, usually stored in /var/log.


.EX
.B ntpd_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntpd_tmp_t context, if you want to store ntpd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B ntpd_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntpd_tmpfs_t context, if you want to store ntpd files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.B ntpd_unit_file_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntpd_unit_file_t context, if you want to treat the files as ntpd unit content.


.EX
.B ntpd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntpd_var_run_t context, if you want to store the ntpd files under the /run directory.


.EX
.B ntpdate_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntpdate_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the ntpdate_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
