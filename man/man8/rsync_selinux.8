.SH "NAME"
rsync_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the rsync processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the rsync processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The rsync processes execute with the rsync_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep rsync_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The rsync_t SELinux type can be entered via the \fBrsync_exec_t\fP file type.

The default entrypoint paths for the rsync_t domain are the following:

/usr/bin/rsync
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux rsync policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their rsync processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for rsync:

.EX
.B rsync_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a rsync_t
can be used to make the process type rsync_t permissive. SELinux does not deny access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  rsync policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run rsync with the tightest access possible.

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux rsync policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their rsync processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP

.PP
.B STANDARD FILE CONTEXT

SELinux defines the file context types for the rsync, if you wanted to
store files with these types in a diffent paths, you need to execute the semanage command to sepecify alternate labeling and then use restorecon to put the labels on disk.

.B semanage fcontext -a -t rsync_data_t '/srv/rsync/content(/.*)?'
.br
.B restorecon -R -v /srv/myrsync_content

Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify labels that match multiple files.

.I The following file types are defined for rsync:


.EX
.PP
.B rsync_data_t
.EE

- Set files with the rsync_data_t type, if you want to treat the files as rsync content.


.EX
.PP
.B rsync_etc_t
.EE

- Set files with the rsync_etc_t type, if you want to store rsync files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.PP
.B rsync_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the rsync_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the rsync_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B rsync_log_t
.EE

- Set files with the rsync_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as rsync log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.PP
.B rsync_tmp_t
.EE

- Set files with the rsync_tmp_t type, if you want to store rsync temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B rsync_var_run_t
.EE

- Set files with the rsync_var_run_t type, if you want to store the rsync files under the /run or /var/run directory.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH SHARING FILES
If you want to share files with multiple domains (Apache, FTP, rsync, Samba), you can set a file context of public_content_t and public_content_rw_t.  These context allow any of the above domains to read the content.  If you want a particular domain to write to the public_content_rw_t domain, you must set the appropriate boolean.
.TP
Allow rsync servers to read the /var/rsync directory by adding the public_content_t file type to the directory and by restoring the file type.
.PP
.B
semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_t "/var/rsync(/.*)?"
.br
.B restorecon -F -R -v /var/rsync
.pp
.TP
Allow rsync servers to read and write /var/tmp/incoming by adding the public_content_rw_t type to the directory and by restoring the file type.  This also requires the allow_rsyncd_anon_write boolean to be set.
.PP
.B
semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_rw_t "/var/rsync/incoming(/.*)?"
.br
.B restorecon -F -R -v /var/rsync/incoming


.PP
If you want to allow rsync to modify public files used for public file transfer services.  Files/Directories must be labeled public_content_rw_t., you must turn on the rsync_anon_write boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P rsync_anon_write 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage port
can also be used to manipulate the port definitions

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
