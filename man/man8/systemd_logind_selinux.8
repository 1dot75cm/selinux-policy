.SH "NAME"
systemd_logind_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the systemd_logind processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the systemd_logind processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The systemd_logind processes execute with the systemd_logind_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier. 

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep systemd_logind_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The systemd_logind_t SELinux type can be entered via the "proc_type,file_type,mtrr_device_t,sysctl_type,filesystem_type,systemd_logind_exec_t,unlabeled_t" file types.  The default entrypoint paths for the systemd_logind_t domain are the following:"

/dev/cpu/mtrr, /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-logind
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. 
SELinux systemd_logind policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their systemd_logind processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following process types are defined for systemd_logind:

.EX
.B systemd_logind_t 
.EE
.PP
Note: 
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE 
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux systemd_logind policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their systemd_logind processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for systemd_logind:


.EX
.PP
.B systemd_logind_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the systemd_logind_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the systemd_logind_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B systemd_logind_inhibit_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the systemd_logind_inhibit_var_run_t type, if you want to store the systemd logind inhibit files under the /run directory.


.EX
.PP
.B systemd_logind_sessions_t 
.EE

- Set files with the systemd_logind_sessions_t type, if you want to treat the files as systemd logind sessions data.


.EX
.PP
.B systemd_logind_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the systemd_logind_var_run_t type, if you want to store the systemd logind files under the /run directory.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/var/run/nologin, /var/run/systemd/users(/.*)?, /var/run/systemd/seats(/.*)?

.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type systemd_logind_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B file_type

	all files on the system
.br

.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.PP
If you want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd serve for the systemd_logind_t, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos for the systemd_logind_t, you must turn on the kerberos_enabled boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P kerberos_enabled 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
