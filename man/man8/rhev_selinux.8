.SH "NAME"
rhev_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the rhev processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the rhev processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux rhev policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their rhev processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for rhev:


.EX
.B rhev_agentd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rhev_agentd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the rhev_agentd_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/share/rhev-agent/rhev-agentd\.py, /usr/share/ovirt-guest-agent
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B rhev_agentd_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rhev_agentd_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as rhev agentd log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B rhev_agentd_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rhev_agentd_tmp_t type, if you want to store rhev agentd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B rhev_agentd_unit_file_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rhev_agentd_unit_file_t type, if you want to treat the files as rhev agentd unit content.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/lib/systemd/system/ovirt-guest-agent\.serviceservice, /lib/systemd/system/ovirt-guest-agent\.service
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B rhev_agentd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rhev_agentd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the rhev agentd files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
