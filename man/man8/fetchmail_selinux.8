.SH "NAME"
fetchmail_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the fetchmail processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the fetchmail processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux fetchmail policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their fetchmail processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for fetchmail:


.EX
.B fetchmail_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the fetchmail_etc_t context, if you want to store fetchmail files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.B fetchmail_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the fetchmail_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the fetchmail_t domain.


.EX
.B fetchmail_home_t 
.EE

- Set files with the fetchmail_home_t context, if you want to store fetchmail files in the users home directory.


.EX
.B fetchmail_uidl_cache_t 
.EE

- Set files with the fetchmail_uidl_cache_t context, if you want to store the files under the /var/cache directory.


.EX
.B fetchmail_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the fetchmail_var_run_t context, if you want to store the fetchmail files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
