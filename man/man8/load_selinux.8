.SH "NAME"
load_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the load processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the load processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  load policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run load with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to prevent all confined domains from loading policy, setting enforcing mode, and changing boolean values.  Set this to true and you have to reboot to set it bac, you must turn on the secure_mode_policyload boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P secure_mode_policyload 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow the graphical login program to execute bootloade, you must turn on the xdm_exec_bootloader boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P xdm_exec_bootloader 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow all domains to have the kernel load module, you must turn on the domain_kernel_load_modules boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P domain_kernel_load_modules 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux load policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their load processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for load:


.EX
.B load_policy_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the load_policy_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the load_policy_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/load_policy, /sbin/load_policy
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B loadkeys_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the loadkeys_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the loadkeys_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/bin/unikeys, /usr/bin/unikeys, /bin/loadkeys, /usr/bin/loadkeys
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
