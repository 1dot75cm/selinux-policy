.SH "NAME"
selinux_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the selinux processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the selinux processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux selinux policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their selinux processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for selinux:


.EX
.B selinux_config_t 
.EE

- Set files with the selinux_config_t context, if you want to treat the files as selinux configuration data.


.EX
.B selinux_munin_plugin_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the selinux_munin_plugin_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the selinux_munin_plugin_t domain.


.EX
.B selinux_munin_plugin_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the selinux_munin_plugin_tmp_t context, if you want to store selinux munin plugin temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B selinux_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the selinux_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the selinux files under the /var/lib directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
