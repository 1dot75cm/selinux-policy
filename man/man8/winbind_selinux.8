.SH "NAME"
winbind_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the winbind processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the winbind processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  winbind policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run winbind with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow Apache to use mod_auth_ntlm_winbin, you must turn on the allow_httpd_mod_auth_ntlm_winbind boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P allow_httpd_mod_auth_ntlm_winbind 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux winbind policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their winbind processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for winbind:


.EX
.B winbind_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the winbind_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the winbind_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B winbind_helper_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the winbind_helper_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the winbind_helper_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B winbind_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the winbind_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as winbind log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.B winbind_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the winbind_var_run_t type, if you want to store the winbind files under the /run directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/cache/samba/winbindd_privileged(/.*)?, /var/lib/samba/winbindd_privileged(/.*)?, /var/run/winbindd(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
