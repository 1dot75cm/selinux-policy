.SH "NAME"
gpsd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the gpsd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the gpsd processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The gpsd processes execute with the gpsd_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep gpsd_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The gpsd_t SELinux type can be entered via the \fBgpsd_exec_t\fP file type.

The default entrypoint paths for the gpsd_t domain are the following:

/usr/sbin/gpsd
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux gpsd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their gpsd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for gpsd:

.EX
.B gpsd_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a gpsd_t
can be used to make the process type gpsd_t permissive. SELinux does not deny access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  gpsd policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run gpsd with the tightest access possible.

.PP
If you want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd server for the gpsd_t, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos for the gpsd_t, you must turn on the kerberos_enabled boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P kerberos_enabled 1
.EE

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports.
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command:

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports.
SELinux gpsd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their gpsd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following port types are defined for gpsd:

.EX
.TP 5
.B gpsd_port_t
.TP 10
.EE


Default Defined Ports:
tcp 2947
.EE
.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type gpsd_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B chronyd_tmpfs_t


.br
.B gpsd_tmpfs_t


.br
.B gpsd_var_run_t

	/var/run/gpsd\.pid
.br
	/var/run/gpsd\.sock
.br

.br
.B ntpd_tmpfs_t


.br
.B root_t

	/
.br
	/initrd
.br

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux gpsd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their gpsd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP

.PP
.B STANDARD FILE CONTEXT

SELinux defines the file context types for the gpsd, if you wanted to
store files with these types in a diffent paths, you need to execute the semanage command to sepecify alternate labeling and then use restorecon to put the labels on disk.

.B semanage fcontext -a -t gpsd_exec_t '/srv/gpsd/content(/.*)?'
.br
.B restorecon -R -v /srv/mygpsd_content

Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify labels that match multiple files.

.I The following file types are defined for gpsd:


.EX
.PP
.B gpsd_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the gpsd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the gpsd_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B gpsd_initrc_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the gpsd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the gpsd_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B gpsd_tmpfs_t
.EE

- Set files with the gpsd_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store gpsd files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.PP
.B gpsd_var_run_t
.EE

- Set files with the gpsd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the gpsd files under the /run or /var/run directory.

.br
.TP 5
Paths:
/var/run/gpsd\.pid, /var/run/gpsd\.sock

.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage port
can also be used to manipulate the port definitions

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
