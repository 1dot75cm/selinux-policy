.SH "NAME"
psad_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the psad processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the psad processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux psad policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their psad processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for psad:


.EX
.B psad_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the psad_etc_t context, if you want to store psad files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.B psad_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the psad_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the psad_t domain.


.EX
.B psad_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the psad_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the psad_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B psad_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the psad_tmp_t context, if you want to store psad temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B psad_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the psad_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the psad files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.B psad_var_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the psad_var_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as psad var log data, usually stored in /var/log.


.EX
.B psad_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the psad_var_run_t context, if you want to store the psad files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
