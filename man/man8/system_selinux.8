.SH "NAME"
system_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the system processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the system processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  system policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run system with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow Git daemon system to access cifs file systems, you must turn on the git_system_use_cifs boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P git_system_use_cifs 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow Git daemon system to search home directories, you must turn on the git_system_enable_homedirs boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P git_system_enable_homedirs 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow Git daemon system to access nfs file systems, you must turn on the git_system_use_nfs boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P git_system_use_nfs 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to enable support for systemd as the init program, you must turn on the init_systemd boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P init_systemd 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux system policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their system processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for system:


.EX
.B system_conf_t 
.EE

- Set files with the system_conf_t type, if you want to treat the files as system configuration data, usually stored under the /etc directory.

.br
Paths: 
/etc/sysctl\.conf(\.old)?, /etc/sysconfig/ipvsadm.*, /etc/sysconfig/ebtables.*, /etc/sysconfig/ip6?tables.*, /etc/sysconfig/system-config-firewall.*
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the

.B restorecon
to apply the labels.
