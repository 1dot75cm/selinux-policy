.SH "NAME"
portmap_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the portmap processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the portmap processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux portmap policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their portmap processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for portmap:


.EX
.B portmap_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the portmap_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the portmap_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/sbin/portmap, /usr/sbin/portmap

.EX
.B portmap_helper_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the portmap_helper_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the portmap_helper_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/pmap_set, /usr/sbin/pmap_dump

.EX
.B portmap_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the portmap_tmp_t context, if you want to store portmap temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B portmap_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the portmap_var_run_t context, if you want to store the portmap files under the /run directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/run/portmap\.upgrade-state
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
