.SH "NAME"
rgmanager_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the rgmanager processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the rgmanager processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux rgmanager policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their rgmanager processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for rgmanager:


.EX
.B rgmanager_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rgmanager_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the rgmanager_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/usr/sbin/rgmanager

.EX
.B rgmanager_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rgmanager_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the rgmanager_initrc_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/rgmanager

.EX
.B rgmanager_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rgmanager_tmp_t context, if you want to store rgmanager temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B rgmanager_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rgmanager_tmpfs_t context, if you want to store rgmanager files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.B rgmanager_var_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rgmanager_var_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as rgmanager var log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/log/cluster/rgmanager\.log

.EX
.B rgmanager_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rgmanager_var_run_t context, if you want to store the rgmanager files under the /run directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/run/rgmanager\.pid, /var/run/cluster/rgmanager\.sk
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  rgmanager policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run rgmanager with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow rgmanager domain to connect to the network using TCP, you must turn on the rgmanager_can_network_connect boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P rgmanager_can_network_connect 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
