.SH "NAME"
consolekit_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the consolekit processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the consolekit processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.PP
If you want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd serve for the consolekit_t, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean.

.EX
setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos for the consolekit_t, you must turn on the kerberos_enabled boolean.

.EX
setsebool -P kerberos_enabled 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux consolekit policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their consolekit processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for consolekit:


.EX
.PP
.B consolekit_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the consolekit_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the consolekit_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B consolekit_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the consolekit_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as consolekit log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.PP
.B consolekit_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the consolekit_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store consolekit files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.PP
.B consolekit_unit_file_t 
.EE

- Set files with the consolekit_unit_file_t type, if you want to treat the files as consolekit unit content.


.EX
.PP
.B consolekit_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the consolekit_var_run_t type, if you want to store the consolekit files under the /run directory.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/var/run/console-kit-daemon\.pid, /var/run/ConsoleKit(/.*)?, /var/run/consolekit\.pid

.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. 
SELinux consolekit policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their consolekit processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following process types are defined for consolekit:

.EX
.B consolekit_t 
.EE
.PP
Note: 
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE 
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
