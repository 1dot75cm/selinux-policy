.SH "NAME"
automount_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the automount processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the automount processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux automount policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their automount processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for automount:


.EX
.B automount_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the automount_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the automount_t domain.


.EX
.B automount_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the automount_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the automount_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B automount_keytab_t 
.EE

- Set files with the automount_keytab_t context, if you want to treat the files as kerberos keytab files.


.EX
.B automount_lock_t 
.EE

- Set files with the automount_lock_t context, if you want to treat the files as automount lock data.


.EX
.B automount_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the automount_tmp_t context, if you want to store automount temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B automount_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the automount_var_run_t context, if you want to store the automount files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
