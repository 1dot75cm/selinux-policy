.SH "NAME"
openvpn_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the openvpn processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the openvpn processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux openvpn policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their openvpn processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for openvpn:


.EX
.B openvpn_etc_rw_t 
.EE

- Set files with the openvpn_etc_rw_t context, if you want to treat the files as openvpn etc read/write content.

.br
Path: 
/etc/openvpn/ipp.txt

.EX
.B openvpn_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the openvpn_etc_t context, if you want to store openvpn files in the /etc directories.

.br
Path: 
/etc/openvpn(/.*)?

.EX
.B openvpn_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the openvpn_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the openvpn_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/usr/sbin/openvpn

.EX
.B openvpn_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the openvpn_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the openvpn_initrc_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/openvpn

.EX
.B openvpn_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the openvpn_tmp_t context, if you want to store openvpn temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B openvpn_var_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the openvpn_var_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as openvpn var log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/log/openvpn.*

.EX
.B openvpn_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the openvpn_var_run_t context, if you want to store the openvpn files under the /run directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/run/openvpn(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  openvpn policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run openvpn with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow openvpn to read home directorie, you must turn on the openvpn_enable_homedirs boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P openvpn_enable_homedirs 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
