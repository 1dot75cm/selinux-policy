.SH "NAME"
callweaver_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the callweaver processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the callweaver processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux callweaver policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their callweaver processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for callweaver:


.EX
.B callweaver_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the callweaver_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the callweaver_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B callweaver_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the callweaver_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the callweaver_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B callweaver_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the callweaver_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as callweaver log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B callweaver_spool_t 
.EE

- Set files with the callweaver_spool_t type, if you want to store the callweaver files under the /var/spool directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B callweaver_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the callweaver_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the callweaver files under the /var/lib directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B callweaver_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the callweaver_var_run_t type, if you want to store the callweaver files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
