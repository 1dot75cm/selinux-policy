.SH "NAME"
ricci_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the ricci processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the ricci processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux ricci policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ricci processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for ricci:


.EX
.B ricci_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ricci_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the ricci_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B ricci_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ricci_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the ricci_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B ricci_modcluster_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ricci_modcluster_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the ricci_modcluster_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B ricci_modcluster_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ricci_modcluster_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the ricci modcluster files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.B ricci_modcluster_var_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ricci_modcluster_var_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as ricci modcluster var log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B ricci_modcluster_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ricci_modcluster_var_run_t type, if you want to store the ricci modcluster files under the /run directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/run/modclusterd\.pid, /var/run/clumond\.sock
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B ricci_modclusterd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ricci_modclusterd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the ricci_modclusterd_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B ricci_modclusterd_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ricci_modclusterd_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store ricci modclusterd files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.B ricci_modlog_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ricci_modlog_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the ricci_modlog_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B ricci_modrpm_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ricci_modrpm_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the ricci_modrpm_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B ricci_modservice_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ricci_modservice_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the ricci_modservice_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux ricci policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ricci processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for ricci:
.EX

.B ricci_modcluster_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 16851
.EE
.B udp 16851
.EE
.EX

.B ricci_port_t

.B tcp 11111
.EE
.B udp 11111
