.SH "NAME"
mplayer_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the mplayer processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the mplayer processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  mplayer policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run mplayer with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow mplayer executable stac, you must turn on the allow_mplayer_execstack boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P allow_mplayer_execstack 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow video playing tools to run unconfine, you must turn on the unconfined_mplayer boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P unconfined_mplayer 1
.EE

.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.PP
If you want to allow users to login using a sssd serve for the mplayer_t, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean.

.EX
setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos for the mplayer_t, you must turn on the allow_kerberos boolean.

.EX
setsebool -P allow_kerberos 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow system to run with NI for the mplayer_t, you must turn on the allow_ypbind boolean.

.EX
setsebool -P allow_ypbind 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux mplayer policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their mplayer processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for mplayer:


.EX
.PP
.B mplayer_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mplayer_etc_t type, if you want to store mplayer files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.PP
.B mplayer_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mplayer_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the mplayer_t domain.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/usr/bin/vlc, /usr/bin/mplayer, /usr/bin/xine

.EX
.PP
.B mplayer_home_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mplayer_home_t type, if you want to store mplayer files in the users home directory.


.EX
.PP
.B mplayer_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mplayer_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store mplayer files on a tmpfs file system.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. 
SELinux mplayer policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their mplayer processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following process types are defined for mplayer:

.EX
.B mplayer_t 
.EE
.PP
Note: 
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE 
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
