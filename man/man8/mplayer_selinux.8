.SH "NAME"
mplayer_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the mplayer processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the mplayer processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux mplayer policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their mplayer processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for mplayer:


.EX
.B mplayer_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mplayer_etc_t context, if you want to store mplayer files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.B mplayer_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mplayer_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the mplayer_t domain.


.EX
.B mplayer_home_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mplayer_home_t context, if you want to store mplayer files in the users home directory.


.EX
.B mplayer_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mplayer_tmpfs_t context, if you want to store mplayer files on a tmpfs file system.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  mplayer policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run mplayer with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow mplayer executable stack, you must turn on the allow_mplayer_execstack boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P allow_mplayer_execstack 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow video playing tools to run unconfined, you must turn on the unconfined_mplayer boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P unconfined_mplayer 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
