.SH "NAME"
quota_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the quota processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the quota processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux quota policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their quota processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for quota:


.EX
.B quota_db_t 
.EE

- Set files with the quota_db_t context, if you want to treat the files as quota database content.


.EX
.B quota_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the quota_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the quota_t domain.


.EX
.B quota_flag_t 
.EE

- Set files with the quota_flag_t context, if you want to treat the files as quota flag data.


.EX
.B quota_nld_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the quota_nld_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the quota_nld_t domain.


.EX
.B quota_nld_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the quota_nld_var_run_t context, if you want to store the quota nld files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
