.SH "NAME"
tuned_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the tuned processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the tuned processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux tuned policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their tuned processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for tuned:


.EX
.B tuned_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tuned_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the tuned_t domain.


.EX
.B tuned_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tuned_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the tuned_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B tuned_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tuned_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as tuned log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.B tuned_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tuned_var_run_t context, if you want to store the tuned files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
