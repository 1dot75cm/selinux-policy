.SH "NAME"
cdrecord_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the cdrecord processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the cdrecord processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux cdrecord policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their cdrecord processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for cdrecord:


.EX
.B cdrecord_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cdrecord_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the cdrecord_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/bin/cdrecord, /usr/bin/wodim, /usr/bin/growisofs
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  cdrecord policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run cdrecord with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow cdrecord to read various content. nfs, samba, removable devices, user temp and untrusted content file, you must turn on the cdrecord_read_content boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P cdrecord_read_content 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
