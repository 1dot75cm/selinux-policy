.SH "NAME"
uucpd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the uucpd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the uucpd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux uucpd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their uucpd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for uucpd:


.EX
.B uucpd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uucpd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the uucpd_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B uucpd_lock_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uucpd_lock_t type, if you want to treat the files as uucpd lock data, stored under the /var/lock directory

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B uucpd_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uucpd_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as uucpd log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B uucpd_ro_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uucpd_ro_t type, if you want to treat the files as uucpd read/only content.


.EX
.B uucpd_rw_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uucpd_rw_t type, if you want to treat the files as uucpd read/write content.


.EX
.B uucpd_spool_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uucpd_spool_t type, if you want to store the uucpd files under the /var/spool directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/spool/uucppublic(/.*)?, /var/spool/uucp(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B uucpd_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uucpd_tmp_t type, if you want to store uucpd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B uucpd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uucpd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the uucpd files under the /run directory.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux uucpd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their uucpd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for uucpd:
.EX

.B uucpd_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 540
.EE
.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
