.SH "NAME"
uucpd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the uucpd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the uucpd processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The uucpd processes execute with the uucpd_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier. 

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep uucpd_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The uucpd_t SELinux type can be entered via the "uucpd_exec_t" file type.  The default entrypoint paths for the uucpd_t domain are the following:"

/usr/sbin/uucico
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. 
SELinux uucpd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their uucpd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following process types are defined for uucpd:

.EX
.B uucpd_t 
.EE
.PP
Note: 
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE 
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux uucpd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their uucpd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for uucpd:


.EX
.PP
.B uucpd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uucpd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the uucpd_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B uucpd_lock_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uucpd_lock_t type, if you want to treat the files as uucpd lock data, stored under the /var/lock directory


.EX
.PP
.B uucpd_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uucpd_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as uucpd log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.PP
.B uucpd_ro_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uucpd_ro_t type, if you want to treat the files as uucpd read/only content.


.EX
.PP
.B uucpd_rw_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uucpd_rw_t type, if you want to treat the files as uucpd read/write content.


.EX
.PP
.B uucpd_spool_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uucpd_spool_t type, if you want to store the uucpd files under the /var/spool directory.


.EX
.PP
.B uucpd_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uucpd_tmp_t type, if you want to store uucpd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B uucpd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uucpd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the uucpd files under the /run directory.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux uucpd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their uucpd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for uucpd:

.EX
.TP 5
.B uucpd_port_t 
.TP 10
.EE


Default Defined Ports:
tcp 540
.EE
.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type uucpd_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B uucpd_lock_t

	/var/lock/uucp(/.*)?
.br

.br
.B uucpd_log_t

	/var/log/uucp(/.*)?
.br

.br
.B uucpd_rw_t


.br
.B uucpd_spool_t

	/var/spool/uucp(/.*)?
.br
	/var/spool/uucppublic(/.*)?
.br

.br
.B uucpd_tmp_t


.br
.B uucpd_var_run_t


.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.PP
If you want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd serve for the uucpd_t, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos for the uucpd_t, you must turn on the kerberos_enabled boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P kerberos_enabled 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage port
can also be used to manipulate the port definitions

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
