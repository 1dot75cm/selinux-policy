.SH "NAME"
dhcpd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the dhcpd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the dhcpd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  dhcpd policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run dhcpd with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow dhcpc client applications to execute iptables command, you must turn on the dhcpc_exec_iptables boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P dhcpc_exec_iptables 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux dhcpd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their dhcpd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for dhcpd:


.EX
.B dhcpd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dhcpd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the dhcpd_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B dhcpd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dhcpd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the dhcpd_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B dhcpd_state_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dhcpd_state_t type, if you want to treat the files as dhcpd state data.

.br
Paths: 
/var/lib/dhcp(3)?/dhcpd\.leases.*, /var/lib/dhcpd(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B dhcpd_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dhcpd_tmp_t type, if you want to store dhcpd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B dhcpd_unit_file_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dhcpd_unit_file_t type, if you want to treat the files as dhcpd unit content.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/lib/systemd/system/dhcpcd.*, /lib/systemd/system/dhcpcd.*
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B dhcpd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dhcpd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the dhcpd files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux dhcpd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their dhcpd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for dhcpd:
.EX

.B dhcpc_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 68,546
.EE
.B udp 68,546
.EE
.EX

.B dhcpd_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 547,548,647,847,7911
.EE
.B udp 67,547,548,647,847
.EE
.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
