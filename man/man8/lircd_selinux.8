.SH "NAME"
lircd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the lircd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the lircd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux lircd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their lircd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for lircd:


.EX
.B lircd_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the lircd_etc_t context, if you want to store lircd files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.B lircd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the lircd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the lircd_t domain.


.EX
.B lircd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the lircd_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the lircd_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B lircd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the lircd_var_run_t context, if you want to store the lircd files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
