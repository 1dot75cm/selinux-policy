.SH "NAME"
lircd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the lircd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the lircd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux lircd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their lircd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for lircd:


.EX
.B lircd_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the lircd_etc_t type, if you want to store lircd files in the /etc directories.

.br
Paths: 
/etc/lircd\.conf, /etc/lirc(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B lircd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the lircd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the lircd_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B lircd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the lircd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the lircd_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B lircd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the lircd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the lircd files under the /run directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/run/lirc(/.*)?, /var/run/lircd(/.*)?, /var/run/lircd\.pid
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux lircd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their lircd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for lircd:
.EX

.B lirc_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 8765
.EE
.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
