.SH "NAME"
qemu_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the qemu processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the qemu processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux qemu policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their qemu processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for qemu:


.EX
.B qemu_dm_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the qemu_dm_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the qemu_dm_t domain.


.EX
.B qemu_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the qemu_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the qemu_t domain.


.EX
.B qemu_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the qemu_var_run_t context, if you want to store the qemu files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  qemu policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run qemu with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow qemu to use cifs/Samba file system, you must turn on the qemu_use_cifs boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P qemu_use_cifs 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow qemu to use serial/parallel communication port, you must turn on the qemu_use_comm boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P qemu_use_comm 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow qemu to use nfs file system, you must turn on the qemu_use_nfs boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P qemu_use_nfs 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow qemu to use usb device, you must turn on the qemu_use_usb boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P qemu_use_usb 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow qemu to connect fully to the networ, you must turn on the qemu_full_network boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P qemu_full_network 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow xend to run qemu-dm. Not required if using paravirt and no vfb, you must turn on the xend_run_qemu boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P xend_run_qemu 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
