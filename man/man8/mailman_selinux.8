.SH "NAME"
mailman_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the mailman processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the mailman processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux mailman policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their mailman processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for mailman:


.EX
.B mailman_archive_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mailman_archive_t context, if you want to treat the files as mailman archive data.


.EX
.B mailman_cgi_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mailman_cgi_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the mailman_cgi_t domain.


.EX
.B mailman_cgi_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mailman_cgi_tmp_t context, if you want to store mailman cgi temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B mailman_data_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mailman_data_t context, if you want to treat the files as mailman content.


.EX
.B mailman_lock_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mailman_lock_t context, if you want to treat the files as mailman lock data, stored under the /var/lock directory


.EX
.B mailman_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mailman_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as mailman log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.B mailman_mail_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mailman_mail_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the mailman_mail_t domain.


.EX
.B mailman_mail_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mailman_mail_tmp_t context, if you want to store mailman mail temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B mailman_queue_exec_t 
.EE

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.
