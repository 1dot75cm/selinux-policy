.SH "NAME"
syslogd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the syslogd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the syslogd processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The syslogd processes execute with the syslogd_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep syslogd_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The syslogd_t SELinux type can be entered via the "syslogd_exec_t" file type.  The default entrypoint paths for the syslogd_t domain are the following:"

/sbin/syslogd, /sbin/minilogd, /sbin/rsyslogd, /sbin/syslog-ng, /usr/sbin/metalog, /usr/sbin/syslogd, /usr/sbin/minilogd, /usr/sbin/rsyslogd, /usr/sbin/syslog-ng, /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-journald, /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-kmsg-syslogd
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux syslogd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their syslogd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for syslogd:

.EX
.B syslogd_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  syslogd policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run syslogd with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow syslogd the ability to read/write terminals, you must turn on the logging_syslogd_use_tty boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P logging_syslogd_use_tty 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow syslogd daemon to send mail, you must turn on the logging_syslogd_can_sendmail boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P logging_syslogd_can_sendmail 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow syslogd the ability to read/write terminals, you must turn on the logging_syslogd_use_tty boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P logging_syslogd_use_tty 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow syslogd daemon to send mail, you must turn on the logging_syslogd_can_sendmail boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P logging_syslogd_can_sendmail 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux syslogd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their syslogd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following file types are defined for syslogd:


.EX
.PP
.B syslogd_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the syslogd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the syslogd_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B syslogd_initrc_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the syslogd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the syslogd_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B syslogd_keytab_t
.EE

- Set files with the syslogd_keytab_t type, if you want to treat the files as kerberos keytab files.


.EX
.PP
.B syslogd_tmp_t
.EE

- Set files with the syslogd_tmp_t type, if you want to store syslogd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B syslogd_var_lib_t
.EE

- Set files with the syslogd_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the syslogd files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.PP
.B syslogd_var_run_t
.EE

- Set files with the syslogd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the syslogd files under the /run directory.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports.
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command:

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports.
SELinux syslogd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their syslogd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following port types are defined for syslogd:

.EX
.TP 5
.B syslogd_port_t
.TP 10
.EE


Default Defined Ports:
tcp 6514
.EE
udp 514,6514
.EE
.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type syslogd_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

If you want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd serve for the syslogd_t, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean.

.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos for the syslogd_t, you must turn on the kerberos_enabled boolean.
