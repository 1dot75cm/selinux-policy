.SH "NAME"
syslogd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the syslogd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the syslogd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  syslogd policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run syslogd with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to determine whether Polipo session daemon can send syslog messages, you must turn on the polipo_session_send_syslog_msg boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P polipo_session_send_syslog_msg 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow syslogd daemon to send mai, you must turn on the logging_syslogd_can_sendmail boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P logging_syslogd_can_sendmail 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow syslogd the ability to read/write terminal, you must turn on the logging_syslogd_use_tty boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P logging_syslogd_use_tty 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux syslogd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their syslogd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for syslogd:


.EX
.B syslogd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the syslogd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the syslogd_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/rsyslogd, /usr/sbin/syslog-ng, /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-kmsg-syslogd, /usr/sbin/metalog, /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-journald, /usr/sbin/syslogd, /usr/sbin/minilogd, /sbin/rsyslogd, /sbin/syslogd, /sbin/syslog-ng, /lib/systemd/systemd-kmsg-syslogd, /sbin/minilogd, /lib/systemd/systemd-journald
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B syslogd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the syslogd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the syslogd_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B syslogd_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the syslogd_tmp_t type, if you want to store syslogd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B syslogd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the syslogd_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the syslogd files under the /var/lib directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/lib/syslog-ng.persist, /var/lib/r?syslog(/.*)?, /var/lib/syslog-ng(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B syslogd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the syslogd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the syslogd files under the /run directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/log/syslog-ng(/.*)?, /var/run/syslog-ng(/.*)?, /var/run/metalog\.pid, /var/run/syslogd\.pid, /var/run/log(/.*)?, /var/run/syslog-ng.ctl
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux syslogd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their syslogd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for syslogd:
.EX

.B syslogd_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 6514
.EE
.B udp 514,6514
.EE
.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
