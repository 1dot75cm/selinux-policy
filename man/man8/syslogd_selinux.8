.SH "NAME"
syslogd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the syslogd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the syslogd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux syslogd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their syslogd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for syslogd:


.EX
.B syslogd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the syslogd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the syslogd_t domain.


.EX
.B syslogd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the syslogd_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the syslogd_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B syslogd_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the syslogd_tmp_t context, if you want to store syslogd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B syslogd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the syslogd_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the syslogd files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.B syslogd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the syslogd_var_run_t context, if you want to store the syslogd files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  syslogd policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run syslogd with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to determine whether Polipo session daemon can send syslog messages., you must turn on the polipo_session_send_syslog_msg boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P polipo_session_send_syslog_msg 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow syslogd daemon to send mail, you must turn on the logging_syslogd_can_sendmail boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P logging_syslogd_can_sendmail 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow syslogd the ability to read/write terminals, you must turn on the logging_syslogd_use_tty boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P logging_syslogd_use_tty 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
