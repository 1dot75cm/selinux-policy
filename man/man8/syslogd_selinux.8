.SH "NAME"
syslogd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the syslogd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the syslogd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  syslogd policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run syslogd with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to determine whether Polipo session daemon can send syslog messages, you must turn on the polipo_session_send_syslog_msg boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P polipo_session_send_syslog_msg 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow syslogd daemon to send mai, you must turn on the logging_syslogd_can_sendmail boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P logging_syslogd_can_sendmail 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow syslogd the ability to read/write terminal, you must turn on the logging_syslogd_use_tty boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P logging_syslogd_use_tty 1
.EE

.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.PP
If you want to allow users to login using a sssd serve for the syslogd_t, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean.

.EX
setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos for the syslogd_t, you must turn on the allow_kerberos boolean.

.EX
setsebool -P allow_kerberos 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow system to run with NI for the syslogd_t, you must turn on the allow_ypbind boolean.

.EX
setsebool -P allow_ypbind 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux syslogd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their syslogd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for syslogd:


.EX
.PP
.B syslogd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the syslogd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the syslogd_t domain.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/rsyslogd, /usr/sbin/syslog-ng, /usr/sbin/metalog, /usr/sbin/syslogd, /usr/sbin/minilogd, /sbin/rsyslogd, /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-kmsg-syslogd, /sbin/syslogd, /sbin/syslog-ng, /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-journald, /sbin/minilogd

.EX
.PP
.B syslogd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the syslogd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the syslogd_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B syslogd_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the syslogd_tmp_t type, if you want to store syslogd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B syslogd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the syslogd_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the syslogd files under the /var/lib directory.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/var/lib/syslog-ng.persist, /var/lib/r?syslog(/.*)?, /var/lib/syslog-ng(/.*)?

.EX
.PP
.B syslogd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the syslogd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the syslogd files under the /run directory.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/var/log/syslog-ng(/.*)?, /var/run/syslogd\.pid, /var/run/syslog-ng(/.*)?, /var/run/metalog\.pid, /var/run/log(/.*)?, /var/run/syslog-ng.ctl

.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux syslogd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their syslogd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for syslogd:

.EX
.TP 5
.B syslogd_port_t 
.TP 10
.EE


Default Defined Ports:
tcp 6514
.EE
udp 514,6514
.EE
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. 
SELinux syslogd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their syslogd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following process types are defined for syslogd:

.EX
.B syslogd_t 
.EE
.PP
Note: 
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE 
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage port
can also be used to manipulate the port definitions

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
