.SH "NAME"
sssd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the sssd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the sssd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux sssd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their sssd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for sssd:


.EX
.B sssd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the sssd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the sssd_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B sssd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the sssd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the sssd_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B sssd_public_t 
.EE

- Set files with the sssd_public_t type, if you want to treat the files as sssd public data.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B sssd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the sssd_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the sssd files under the /var/lib directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B sssd_var_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the sssd_var_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as sssd var log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B sssd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the sssd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the sssd files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
