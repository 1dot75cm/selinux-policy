.SH "NAME"
sssd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the sssd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the sssd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux sssd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their sssd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for sssd:


.EX
.B sssd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the sssd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the sssd_t domain.


.EX
.B sssd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the sssd_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the sssd_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B sssd_public_t 
.EE

- Set files with the sssd_public_t context, if you want to treat the files as sssd public data.


.EX
.B sssd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the sssd_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the sssd files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.B sssd_var_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the sssd_var_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as sssd var log data, usually stored in /var/log.


.EX
.B sssd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the sssd_var_run_t context, if you want to store the sssd files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
