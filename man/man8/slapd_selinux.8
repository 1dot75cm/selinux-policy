.SH "NAME"
slapd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the slapd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the slapd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux slapd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their slapd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for slapd:


.EX
.B slapd_cert_t 
.EE

- Set files with the slapd_cert_t type, if you want to treat the files as slapd certificate data.


.EX
.B slapd_db_t 
.EE

- Set files with the slapd_db_t type, if you want to treat the files as slapd database content.

.br
Paths: 
/etc/openldap/slapd\.d(/.*)?, /var/lib/ldap(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B slapd_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the slapd_etc_t type, if you want to store slapd files in the /etc directories.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B slapd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the slapd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the slapd_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B slapd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the slapd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the slapd_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B slapd_keytab_t 
.EE

- Set files with the slapd_keytab_t type, if you want to treat the files as kerberos keytab files.


.EX
.B slapd_lock_t 
.EE

- Set files with the slapd_lock_t type, if you want to treat the files as slapd lock data, stored under the /var/lock directory


.EX
.B slapd_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the slapd_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as slapd log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.B slapd_replog_t 
.EE

- Set files with the slapd_replog_t type, if you want to treat the files as slapd replog data.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B slapd_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the slapd_tmp_t type, if you want to store slapd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B slapd_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the slapd_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store slapd files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.B slapd_unit_file_t 
.EE

- Set files with the slapd_unit_file_t type, if you want to treat the files as slapd unit content.


.EX
.B slapd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the slapd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the slapd files under the /run directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/run/slapd\.args, /var/run/openldap(/.*)?, /var/run/slapd\.pid, /var/run/ldapi, /var/run/slapd.*
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
