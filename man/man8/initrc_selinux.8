.SH "NAME"
initrc_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the initrc processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the initrc processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux initrc policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their initrc processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for initrc:


.EX
.B initrc_devpts_t 
.EE

- Set files with the initrc_devpts_t context, if you want to treat the files as initrc devpts data.


.EX
.B initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B initrc_state_t 
.EE

- Set files with the initrc_state_t context, if you want to treat the files as initrc state data.


.EX
.B initrc_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the initrc_tmp_t context, if you want to store initrc temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B initrc_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the initrc_var_run_t context, if you want to store the initrc files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
