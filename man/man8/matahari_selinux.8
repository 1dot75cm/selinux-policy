.SH "NAME"
matahari_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the matahari processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the matahari processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux matahari policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their matahari processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for matahari:


.EX
.B matahari_hostd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the matahari_hostd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the matahari_hostd_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/matahari-qmf-hostd, /usr/sbin/matahari-hostd, /usr/sbin/matahari-dbus-hostd
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B matahari_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the matahari_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the matahari_initrc_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/matahari-service, /etc/rc\.d/init\.d/matahari-sysconfig, /etc/rc\.d/init\.d/matahari-host, /etc/rc\.d/init\.d/matahari-net
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B matahari_netd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the matahari_netd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the matahari_netd_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/matahari-qmf-networkd, /usr/sbin/matahari-dbus-networkd, /usr/sbin/matahari-netd
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B matahari_serviced_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the matahari_serviced_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the matahari_serviced_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/matahari-serviced, /usr/sbin/matahari-dbus-serviced, /usr/sbin/matahari-qmf-serviced
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B matahari_sysconfigd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the matahari_sysconfigd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the matahari_sysconfigd_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B matahari_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the matahari_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the matahari files under the /var/lib directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B matahari_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the matahari_var_run_t type, if you want to store the matahari files under the /run directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/run/matahari(/.*)?, /var/run/matahari\.pid, /var/run/matahari-broker\.pid
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux matahari policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their matahari processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for matahari:
.EX

.B matahari_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 49000
.EE
.B udp 49000
.EE
.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
