.SH "NAME"
snort_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the snort processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the snort processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux snort policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their snort processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for snort:


.EX
.B snort_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the snort_etc_t type, if you want to store snort files in the /etc directories.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B snort_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the snort_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the snort_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/snort-plain, /usr/s?bin/snort
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B snort_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the snort_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the snort_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B snort_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the snort_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as snort log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B snort_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the snort_tmp_t type, if you want to store snort temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B snort_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the snort_var_run_t type, if you want to store the snort files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
