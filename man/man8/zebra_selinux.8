.SH "NAME"
zebra_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the zebra processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the zebra processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The zebra processes execute with the zebra_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep zebra_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The zebra_t SELinux type can be entered via the \fBzebra_exec_t\fP file type.

The default entrypoint paths for the zebra_t domain are the following:

/usr/sbin/rip.*, /usr/sbin/ospf.*, /usr/sbin/bgpd, /usr/sbin/zebra
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux zebra policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their zebra processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for zebra:

.EX
.B zebra_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a zebra_t
can be used to make the process type zebra_t permissive. SELinux does not deny access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  zebra policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run zebra with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow zebra daemon to write it configuration files, you must turn on the zebra_write_config boolean. Disabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P zebra_write_config 1

.EE

.PP

.EE

.PP
If you want to allow system to run with NIS, you must turn on the nis_enabled boolean. Disabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P nis_enabled 1

.EE

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports.
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command:

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports.
SELinux zebra policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their zebra processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following port types are defined for zebra:

.EX
.TP 5
.B zebra_port_t
.TP 10
.EE


Default Defined Ports:
tcp 2600-2604,2606
.EE
udp 2600-2604,2606
.EE
.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type zebra_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B root_t

	/
.br
	/initrd
.br

.br
.B zebra_conf_t

	/etc/zebra(/.*)?
.br
	/etc/quagga(/.*)?
.br

.br
.B zebra_log_t

	/var/log/zebra(/.*)?
.br
	/var/log/quagga(/.*)?
.br

.br
.B zebra_var_run_t

	/var/run/quagga(/.*)?
.br
	/var/run/\.zebra
.br
	/var/run/\.zserv
.br

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux zebra policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their zebra processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP

.PP
.B STANDARD FILE CONTEXT

SELinux defines the file context types for the zebra, if you wanted to
store files with these types in a diffent paths, you need to execute the semanage command to sepecify alternate labeling and then use restorecon to put the labels on disk.

.B semanage fcontext -a -t zebra_conf_t '/srv/zebra/content(/.*)?'
.br
.B restorecon -R -v /srv/myzebra_content

Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify labels that match multiple files.

.I The following file types are defined for zebra:


.EX
.PP
.B zebra_conf_t
.EE

- Set files with the zebra_conf_t type, if you want to treat the files as zebra configuration data, usually stored under the /etc directory.

.br
.TP 5
Paths:
/etc/zebra(/.*)?, /etc/quagga(/.*)?

.EX
.PP
.B zebra_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the zebra_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the zebra_t domain.

.br
.TP 5
Paths:
/usr/sbin/rip.*, /usr/sbin/ospf.*, /usr/sbin/bgpd, /usr/sbin/zebra

.EX
.PP
.B zebra_initrc_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the zebra_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the zebra_initrc_t domain.

.br

/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/bgpd, /etc/rc\.d/init\.d/ripd, /etc/rc\.d/init\.d/ospfd, /etc/rc\.d/init\.d/zebra, /etc/rc\.d/init\.d/ospf6d, /etc/rc\.d/init\.d/ripngd

.EX
.PP
.B zebra_log_t
.EE

- Set files with the zebra_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as zebra log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

.br
.TP 5
Paths:
/var/log/zebra(/.*)?, /var/log/quagga(/.*)?

.EX
.PP
.B zebra_tmp_t
.EE

- Set files with the zebra_tmp_t type, if you want to store zebra temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B zebra_var_run_t
.EE

- Set files with the zebra_var_run_t type, if you want to store the zebra files under the /run or /var/run directory.

.br
.TP 5
Paths:
/var/run/quagga(/.*)?, /var/run/\.zebra, /var/run/\.zserv

.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage port
can also be used to manipulate the port definitions

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
