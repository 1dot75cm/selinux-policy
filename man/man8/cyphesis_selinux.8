.SH "NAME"
cyphesis_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the cyphesis processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the cyphesis processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux cyphesis policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their cyphesis processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for cyphesis:


.EX
.B cyphesis_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cyphesis_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the cyphesis_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B cyphesis_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cyphesis_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as cyphesis log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B cyphesis_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cyphesis_tmp_t type, if you want to store cyphesis temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B cyphesis_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cyphesis_var_run_t type, if you want to store the cyphesis files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux cyphesis policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their cyphesis processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for cyphesis:
.EX

.B cyphesis_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 6767,6769,6780-6799
.EE
.B udp 32771
.EE
.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
