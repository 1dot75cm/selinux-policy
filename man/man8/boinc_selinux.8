.SH "NAME"
boinc_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the boinc processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the boinc processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux boinc policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their boinc processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for boinc:


.EX
.B boinc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the boinc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the boinc_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/usr/bin/boinc_client

.EX
.B boinc_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the boinc_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the boinc_initrc_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/boinc-client

.EX
.B boinc_project_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the boinc_project_tmp_t context, if you want to store boinc project temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B boinc_project_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the boinc_project_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the boinc project files under the /var/lib directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/lib/boinc/projects(/.*)?, /var/lib/boinc/slots(/.*)?

.EX
.B boinc_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the boinc_tmp_t context, if you want to store boinc temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B boinc_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the boinc_tmpfs_t context, if you want to store boinc files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.B boinc_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the boinc_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the boinc files under the /var/lib directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/lib/boinc(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
