.SH "NAME"
dmesg_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the dmesg processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the dmesg processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux dmesg policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their dmesg processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for dmesg:


.EX
.B dmesg_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dmesg_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the dmesg_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  dmesg policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run dmesg with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow users to read system messages., you must turn on the user_dmesg boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P user_dmesg 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
