.SH "NAME"
dmesg_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the dmesg processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the dmesg processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  dmesg policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run dmesg with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow users to read system messages, you must turn on the user_dmesg boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P user_dmesg 1
.EE

.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux dmesg policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their dmesg processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for dmesg:


.EX
.PP
.B dmesg_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dmesg_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the dmesg_t domain.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/usr/bin/dmesg, /bin/dmesg

.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. 
SELinux dmesg policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their dmesg processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following process types are defined for dmesg:

.EX
.B dmesg_t 
.EE
.PP
Note: 
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE 
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux user type dmesg_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.
