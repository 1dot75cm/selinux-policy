.SH "NAME"
virtd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the virtd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the virtd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  virtd policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run virtd with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow confined virtual guests to read fuse file, you must turn on the virt_use_fusefs boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P virt_use_fusefs 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined virtual guests to manage nfs file, you must turn on the virt_use_nfs boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P virt_use_nfs 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined virtual guests to use serial/parallel communication port, you must turn on the virt_use_comm boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P virt_use_comm 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined virtual guests to interact with the xserve, you must turn on the virt_use_xserver boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P virt_use_xserver 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined virtual guests to manage device configuration, (pci, you must turn on the virt_use_sysfs boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P virt_use_sysfs 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined virtual guests to use executable memory and executable stac, you must turn on the virt_use_execmem boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P virt_use_execmem 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined virtual guests to interact with the sanloc, you must turn on the virt_use_sanlock boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P virt_use_sanlock 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined virtual guests to use usb device, you must turn on the virt_use_usb boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P virt_use_usb 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined virtual guests to manage cifs file, you must turn on the virt_use_samba boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P virt_use_samba 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux virtd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their virtd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for virtd:


.EX
.B virtd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the virtd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the virtd_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/condor_vm-gahp, /usr/bin/imgfac\.py, /usr/bin/imagefactory, /usr/bin/nova-compute, /usr/sbin/libvirtd
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B virtd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the virtd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the virtd_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B virtd_keytab_t 
.EE

- Set files with the virtd_keytab_t type, if you want to treat the files as kerberos keytab files.


.EX
.B virtd_lxc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the virtd_lxc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the virtd_lxc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B virtd_lxc_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the virtd_lxc_var_run_t type, if you want to store the virtd lxc files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux virtd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their virtd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for virtd:
.EX

.B virt_migration_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 49152-49216
.EE
.EX

.B virt_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 16509,16514
.EE
.B udp 16509,16514
.EE
.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
