.SH "NAME"
qpidd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the qpidd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the qpidd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux qpidd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their qpidd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for qpidd:


.EX
.B qpidd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the qpidd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the qpidd_t domain.


.EX
.B qpidd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the qpidd_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the qpidd_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B qpidd_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the qpidd_tmpfs_t context, if you want to store qpidd files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.B qpidd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the qpidd_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the qpidd files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.B qpidd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the qpidd_var_run_t context, if you want to store the qpidd files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B system-config-selinux
