.SH "NAME"
innd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the innd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the innd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux innd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their innd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for innd:


.EX
.B innd_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the innd_etc_t type, if you want to store innd files in the /etc directories.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B innd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the innd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the innd_t domain.

.EX
.B innd_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the innd_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as innd log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B innd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the innd_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the innd files under the /var/lib directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon

.EX
.B innd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the innd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the innd files under the /run directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/run/innd(/.*)?, /var/run/news(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux innd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their innd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for innd:
.EX

.B innd_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 119
.EE
.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
