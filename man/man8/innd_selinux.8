.SH "NAME"
innd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the innd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the innd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux innd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their innd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for innd:


.EX
.B innd_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the innd_etc_t context, if you want to store innd files in the /etc directories.

.br
Path: 
/etc/news(/.*)?

.EX
.B innd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the innd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the innd_t domain.

.EX
.B innd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the innd_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the innd_initrc_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/innd

.EX
.B innd_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the innd_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as innd log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/log/news(/.*)?

.EX
.B innd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the innd_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the innd files under the /var/lib directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/lib/news(/.*)?

.EX
.B innd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the innd_var_run_t context, if you want to store the innd files under the /run directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/run/innd(/.*)?, /var/run/news(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
