.SH "NAME"
innd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the innd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the innd processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The innd processes execute with the innd_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier. 

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep innd_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The innd_t SELinux type can be entered via the "innd_exec_t" file type.  The default entrypoint paths for the innd_t domain are the following:"

/usr/sbin/innd.*, /usr/bin/suck, /etc/news/boot, /usr/bin/inews, /usr/bin/rnews, /usr/bin/rpost, /usr/sbin/in\.nnrpd, /usr/lib/news/bin/sm, /usr/lib/news/bin/innd, /usr/lib/news/bin/inews, /usr/lib/news/bin/inndf, /usr/lib/news/bin/nnrpd, /usr/lib/news/bin/rnews, /usr/lib/news/bin/expire, /usr/lib/news/bin/fastrm, /usr/lib/news/bin/shlock, /usr/lib/news/bin/actsync, /usr/lib/news/bin/archive, /usr/lib/news/bin/batcher, /usr/lib/news/bin/ctlinnd, /usr/lib/news/bin/getlist, /usr/lib/news/bin/innfeed, /usr/lib/news/bin/innxmit, /usr/lib/news/bin/makedbz, /usr/lib/news/bin/nntpget, /usr/lib/news/bin/buffchan, /usr/lib/news/bin/convdate, /usr/lib/news/bin/cvtbatch, /usr/lib/news/bin/filechan, /usr/lib/news/bin/overchan, /usr/lib/news/bin/inndstart, /usr/lib/news/bin/innxbatch, /usr/lib/news/bin/expireover, /usr/lib/news/bin/innconfval, /usr/lib/news/bin/shrinkfile, /usr/lib/news/bin/grephistory, /usr/lib/news/bin/makehistory, /usr/lib/news/bin/newsrequeue, /usr/lib/news/bin/ovdb_recover, /usr/lib/news/bin/prunehistory, /usr/lib/news/bin/startinnfeed
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. 
SELinux innd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their innd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following process types are defined for innd:

.EX
.B innd_t 
.EE
.PP
Note: 
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE 
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux innd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their innd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for innd:


.EX
.PP
.B innd_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the innd_etc_t type, if you want to store innd files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.PP
.B innd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the innd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the innd_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B innd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the innd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the innd_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B innd_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the innd_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as innd log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.PP
.B innd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the innd_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the innd files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.PP
.B innd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the innd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the innd files under the /run directory.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux innd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their innd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for innd:

.EX
.TP 5
.B innd_port_t 
.TP 10
.EE


Default Defined Ports:
tcp 119
.EE
.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type innd_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B innd_log_t

	/var/log/news(/.*)?
.br

.br
.B innd_var_lib_t

	/var/lib/news(/.*)?
.br

.br
.B innd_var_run_t

	/var/run/innd(/.*)?
.br
	/var/run/news(/.*)?
.br

.br
.B news_spool_t

	/var/spool/news(/.*)?
.br

.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
