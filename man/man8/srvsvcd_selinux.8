.SH "NAME"
srvsvcd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the srvsvcd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the srvsvcd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux srvsvcd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their srvsvcd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for srvsvcd:


.EX
.B srvsvcd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the srvsvcd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the srvsvcd_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/usr/sbin/srvsvcd

.EX
.B srvsvcd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the srvsvcd_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the srvsvcd files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.B srvsvcd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the srvsvcd_var_run_t context, if you want to store the srvsvcd files under the /run directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/run/srvsvcd.pid

.EX
.B srvsvcd_var_socket_t 
.EE

- Set files with the srvsvcd_var_socket_t context, if you want to treat the files as srvsvcd var socket data.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
