.SH "NAME"
postgrey_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the postgrey processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the postgrey processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The postgrey processes execute with the postgrey_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier. 

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep postgrey_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The postgrey_t SELinux type can be entered via the "postgrey_exec_t" file type.  The default entrypoint paths for the postgrey_t domain are the following:"

/usr/sbin/postgrey
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. 
SELinux postgrey policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their postgrey processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following process types are defined for postgrey:

.EX
.B postgrey_t 
.EE
.PP
Note: 
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE 
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux postgrey policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their postgrey processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for postgrey:


.EX
.PP
.B postgrey_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the postgrey_etc_t type, if you want to store postgrey files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.PP
.B postgrey_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the postgrey_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the postgrey_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B postgrey_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the postgrey_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the postgrey_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B postgrey_spool_t 
.EE

- Set files with the postgrey_spool_t type, if you want to store the postgrey files under the /var/spool directory.


.EX
.PP
.B postgrey_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the postgrey_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the postgrey files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.PP
.B postgrey_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the postgrey_var_run_t type, if you want to store the postgrey files under the /run directory.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux postgrey policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their postgrey processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for postgrey:

.EX
.TP 5
.B postgrey_port_t 
.TP 10
.EE


Default Defined Ports:
tcp 60000
.EE
.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type postgrey_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B postfix_spool_type


.br
.B postgrey_spool_t

	/var/spool/postfix/postgrey(/.*)?
.br

.br
.B postgrey_var_lib_t

.B postgrey_var_run_t
