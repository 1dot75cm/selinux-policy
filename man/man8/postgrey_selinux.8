.SH "NAME"
postgrey_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the postgrey processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the postgrey processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux postgrey policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their postgrey processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for postgrey:


.EX
.B postgrey_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the postgrey_etc_t type, if you want to store postgrey files in the /etc directories.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B postgrey_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the postgrey_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the postgrey_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B postgrey_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the postgrey_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the postgrey_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B postgrey_spool_t 
.EE

- Set files with the postgrey_spool_t type, if you want to store the postgrey files under the /var/spool directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B postgrey_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the postgrey_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the postgrey files under the /var/lib directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B postgrey_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the postgrey_var_run_t type, if you want to store the postgrey files under the /run directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/run/postgrey\.pid, /var/run/postgrey(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux postgrey policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their postgrey processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for postgrey:
.EX

.B postgrey_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 60000
.EE
.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
