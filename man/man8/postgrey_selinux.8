.SH "NAME"
postgrey_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the postgrey processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the postgrey processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux postgrey policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their postgrey processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for postgrey:


.EX
.B postgrey_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the postgrey_etc_t context, if you want to store postgrey files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.B postgrey_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the postgrey_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the postgrey_t domain.


.EX
.B postgrey_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the postgrey_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the postgrey_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B postgrey_spool_t 
.EE

- Set files with the postgrey_spool_t context, if you want to store the postgrey files in the /var/spool directories.


.EX
.B postgrey_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the postgrey_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the postgrey files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.B postgrey_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the postgrey_var_run_t context, if you want to store the postgrey files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  postgrey policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run postgrey with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow users to connect to PostgreSQ, you must turn on the allow_user_postgresql_connect boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P allow_user_postgresql_connect 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
