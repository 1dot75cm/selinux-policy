.SH "NAME"
cgred_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the cgred processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the cgred processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux cgred policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their cgred processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for cgred:


.EX
.B cgred_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cgred_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the cgred_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/sbin/cgrulesengd, /usr/sbin/cgrulesengd
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B cgred_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cgred_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the cgred_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B cgred_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cgred_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as cgred log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B cgred_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cgred_var_run_t type, if you want to store the cgred files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
