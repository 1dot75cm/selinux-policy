.SH "NAME"
radvd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the radvd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the radvd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux radvd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their radvd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for radvd:


.EX
.B radvd_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the radvd_etc_t context, if you want to store radvd files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.B radvd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the radvd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the radvd_t domain.


.EX
.B radvd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the radvd_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the radvd_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B radvd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the radvd_var_run_t context, if you want to store the radvd files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
