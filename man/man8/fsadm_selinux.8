.SH "NAME"
fsadm_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the fsadm processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the fsadm processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux fsadm policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their fsadm processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for fsadm:


.EX
.B fsadm_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the fsadm_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the fsadm_t domain.


.EX
.B fsadm_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the fsadm_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as fsadm log data, usually stored in /var/log.


.EX
.B fsadm_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the fsadm_tmp_t context, if you want to store fsadm temporary files in the /tmp directories.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
