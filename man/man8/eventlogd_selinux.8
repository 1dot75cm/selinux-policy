.SH "NAME"
eventlogd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the eventlogd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the eventlogd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux eventlogd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their eventlogd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for eventlogd:


.EX
.B eventlogd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the eventlogd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the eventlogd_t domain.


.EX
.B eventlogd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the eventlogd_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the eventlogd files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.B eventlogd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the eventlogd_var_run_t context, if you want to store the eventlogd files under the /run directory.


.EX
.B eventlogd_var_socket_t 
.EE

- Set files with the eventlogd_var_socket_t context, if you want to treat the files as eventlogd var socket data.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
