.SH "NAME"
smbmount_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the smbmount processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the smbmount processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.PP
If you want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd serve for the smbmount_t, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos for the smbmount_t, you must turn on the kerberos_enabled boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P kerberos_enabled 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux smbmount policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their smbmount processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for smbmount:


.EX
.PP
.B smbmount_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the smbmount_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the smbmount_t domain.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/usr/bin/smbmnt, /usr/bin/smbmount

.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. 
SELinux smbmount policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their smbmount processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following process types are defined for smbmount:

.EX
.B smbmount_t 
.EE
.PP
Note: 
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE 
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux user type smbmount_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.
