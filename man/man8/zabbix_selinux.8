.SH "NAME"
zabbix_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the zabbix processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the zabbix processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux zabbix policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their zabbix processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for zabbix:


.EX
.B zabbix_agent_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the zabbix_agent_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the zabbix_agent_t domain.


.EX
.B zabbix_agent_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the zabbix_agent_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the zabbix_agent_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B zabbix_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the zabbix_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the zabbix_t domain.


.EX
.B zabbix_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the zabbix_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the zabbix_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B zabbix_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the zabbix_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as zabbix log data, usually stored in /var/log.


.EX
.B zabbix_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the zabbix_tmp_t context, if you want to store zabbix temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B zabbix_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the zabbix_tmpfs_t context, if you want to store zabbix files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.B zabbix_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the zabbix_var_run_t context, if you want to store the zabbix files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  zabbix policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run zabbix with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow zabbix to connect to unreserved ports, you must turn on the zabbix_can_network boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P zabbix_can_network 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow http daemon to connect to zabbix, you must turn on the httpd_can_connect_zabbix boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P httpd_can_connect_zabbix 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
