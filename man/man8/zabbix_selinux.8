.SH "NAME"
zabbix_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the zabbix processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the zabbix processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  zabbix policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run zabbix with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow zabbix to connect to unreserved port, you must turn on the zabbix_can_network boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P zabbix_can_network 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow http daemon to connect to zabbi, you must turn on the httpd_can_connect_zabbix boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P httpd_can_connect_zabbix 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux zabbix policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their zabbix processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for zabbix:


.EX
.PP
.B zabbix_agent_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the zabbix_agent_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the zabbix_agent_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B zabbix_agent_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the zabbix_agent_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the zabbix_agent_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B zabbix_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the zabbix_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the zabbix_t domain.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/zabbix_server_sqlite3, /usr/sbin/zabbix_server_mysql, /usr/sbin/zabbix_server_pgsql, /usr/sbin/zabbix_server

.EX
.PP
.B zabbix_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the zabbix_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the zabbix_initrc_t domain.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/zabbix-server, /etc/rc\.d/init\.d/zabbix

.EX
.PP
.B zabbix_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the zabbix_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as zabbix log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.PP
.B zabbix_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the zabbix_tmp_t type, if you want to store zabbix temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B zabbix_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the zabbix_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store zabbix files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.PP
.B zabbix_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the zabbix_var_run_t type, if you want to store the zabbix files under the /run directory.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux zabbix policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their zabbix processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for zabbix:

.EX
.TP 5
.B zabbix_agent_port_t 
.TP 10
.EE


Default Defined Ports:
tcp 8021
.EE

.EX
.TP 5
.B zabbix_port_t 
.TP 10
.EE


Default Defined Ports:
tcp 8021
.EE
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. 
SELinux zabbix policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their zabbix processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following process types are defined for zabbix:

.EX
.B zabbix_agent_t, zabbix_t 
.EE
.PP
Note: 
.B semanage permississive -a PROCESS_TYPE 
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules

.B semanage port
can also be used to manipulate the port definitions

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
