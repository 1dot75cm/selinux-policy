.SH "NAME"
snmpd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the snmpd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the snmpd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux snmpd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their snmpd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for snmpd:


.EX
.B snmpd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the snmpd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the snmpd_t domain.


.EX
.B snmpd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the snmpd_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the snmpd_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B snmpd_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the snmpd_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as snmpd log data, usually stored in /var/log.


.EX
.B snmpd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the snmpd_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the snmpd files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.B snmpd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the snmpd_var_run_t context, if you want to store the snmpd files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
