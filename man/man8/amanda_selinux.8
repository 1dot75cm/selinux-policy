.SH "NAME"
amanda_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the amanda processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the amanda processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux amanda policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their amanda processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for amanda:


.EX
.B amanda_amandates_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amanda_amandates_t type, if you want to treat the files as amanda amandates data.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B amanda_config_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amanda_config_t type, if you want to treat the files as amanda configuration data, usually stored under the /etc directory.

.br
Paths: 
/etc/amanda(/.*)?, /var/lib/amanda/\.amandahosts
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B amanda_data_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amanda_data_t type, if you want to treat the files as amanda content.

.br
Paths: 
/var/lib/amanda/[^/]+(/.*)?, /etc/amanda/.*/tapelist(/.*)?, /etc/amanda/.*/index(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B amanda_dumpdates_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amanda_dumpdates_t type, if you want to treat the files as amanda dumpdates data.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B amanda_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amanda_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the amanda_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B amanda_gnutarlists_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amanda_gnutarlists_t type, if you want to treat the files as amanda gnutarlists data.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B amanda_inetd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amanda_inetd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the amanda_inetd_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/lib/amanda/amindexd, /usr/lib/amanda/amidxtaped, /usr/lib/amanda/amandad
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B amanda_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amanda_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as amanda log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/log/amanda(/.*)?, /var/lib/amanda/[^/]*/log(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B amanda_recover_dir_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amanda_recover_dir_t type, if you want to treat the files as amanda recover dir data.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B amanda_recover_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amanda_recover_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the amanda_recover_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B amanda_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amanda_tmp_t type, if you want to store amanda temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B amanda_usr_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amanda_usr_lib_t type, if you want to treat the files as amanda usr lib data.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B amanda_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amanda_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the amanda files under the /var/lib directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/lib/amanda, /var/lib/amanda/[^/]+/index(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux amanda policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their amanda processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for amanda:
.EX

.B amanda_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 10080-10083
.EE
.B udp 10080-10082
