.SH "NAME"
bootloader_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the bootloader processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the bootloader processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux bootloader policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their bootloader processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for bootloader:


.EX
.B bootloader_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the bootloader_etc_t context, if you want to store bootloader files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.B bootloader_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the bootloader_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the bootloader_t domain.


.EX
.B bootloader_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the bootloader_tmp_t context, if you want to store bootloader temporary files in the /tmp directories.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  bootloader policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run bootloader with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow the graphical login program to execute bootloader, you must turn on the xdm_exec_bootloader boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P xdm_exec_bootloader 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
