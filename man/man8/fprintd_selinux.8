.SH "NAME"
fprintd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the fprintd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the fprintd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux fprintd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their fprintd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for fprintd:


.EX
.B fprintd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the fprintd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the fprintd_t domain.


.EX
.B fprintd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the fprintd_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the fprintd files under the /var/lib directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
