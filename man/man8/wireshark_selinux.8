.SH "NAME"
wireshark_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the wireshark processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the wireshark processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux wireshark policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their wireshark processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for wireshark:


.EX
.B wireshark_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the wireshark_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the wireshark_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B wireshark_home_t 
.EE

- Set files with the wireshark_home_t type, if you want to store wireshark files in the users home directory.


.EX
.B wireshark_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the wireshark_tmp_t type, if you want to store wireshark temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B wireshark_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the wireshark_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store wireshark files on a tmpfs file system.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
