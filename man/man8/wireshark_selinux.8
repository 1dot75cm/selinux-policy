.SH "NAME"
wireshark_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the wireshark processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the wireshark processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux wireshark policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their wireshark processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for wireshark:


.EX
.B wireshark_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the wireshark_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the wireshark_t domain.


.EX
.B wireshark_home_t 
.EE

- Set files with the wireshark_home_t context, if you want to store wireshark files in the users home directory.


.EX
.B wireshark_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the wireshark_tmp_t context, if you want to store wireshark temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B wireshark_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the wireshark_tmpfs_t context, if you want to store wireshark files on a tmpfs file system.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
