.SH "NAME"
vmware_host_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the vmware_host processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the vmware_host processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The vmware_host processes execute with the vmware_host_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep vmware_host_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The vmware_host_t SELinux type can be entered via the \fBvmware_host_exec_t\fP file type.

The default entrypoint paths for the vmware_host_t domain are the following:

/opt/vmware/(workstation|player)/bin/vmnet-natd, /opt/vmware/(workstation|player)/bin/vmnet-dhcpd, /opt/vmware/(workstation|player)/bin/vmware-nmbd, /opt/vmware/(workstation|player)/bin/vmware-smbd, /opt/vmware/(workstation|player)/bin/vmnet-bridge, /opt/vmware/(workstation|player)/bin/vmnet-netifup, /opt/vmware/(workstation|player)/bin/vmnet-sniffer, /opt/vmware/(workstation|player)/bin/vmware-smbpasswd, /opt/vmware/(workstation|player)/bin/vmware-smbpasswd\.bin, /usr/sbin/vmware-guest.*, /usr/lib/vmware-tools/sbin32/vmware.*, /usr/lib/vmware-tools/sbin64/vmware.*, /usr/bin/vmnet-natd, /usr/bin/vmware-vmx, /usr/bin/vmnet-dhcpd, /usr/bin/vmware-nmbd, /usr/bin/vmware-smbd, /usr/bin/vmnet-bridge, /usr/bin/vmnet-netifup, /usr/bin/vmnet-sniffer, /usr/bin/vmware-network, /usr/bin/vmware-smbpasswd, /usr/bin/vmware-smbpasswd\.bin, /usr/lib/vmware/bin/vmware-vmx
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux vmware_host policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their vmware_host processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for vmware_host:

.EX
.B vmware_host_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a vmware_host_t
can be used to make the process type vmware_host_t permissive. SELinux does not deny access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  vmware_host policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run vmware_host with the tightest access possible.

.EX
.B setsebool -P global_ssp 1

.EX
.B setsebool -P nscd_use_shm 1

.EE

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type vmware_host_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B root_t

	/
.br
	/initrd
.br

.br
.B systemd_passwd_var_run_t

	/var/run/systemd/ask-password(/.*)?
.br
	/var/run/systemd/ask-password-block(/.*)?
.br

.br
.B vmware_host_pid_t


.br
.B vmware_host_tmp_t


.br
.B vmware_sys_conf_t

	/etc/vmware.*(/.*)?
.br
	/usr/lib/vmware/config

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux vmware_host policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their vmware_host processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP

.PP
.B STANDARD FILE CONTEXT

SELinux defines the file context types for the vmware_host, if you wanted to
store files with these types in a diffent paths, you need to execute the semanage command to sepecify alternate labeling and then use restorecon to put the labels on disk.

.B semanage fcontext -a -t vmware_host_exec_t '/srv/vmware_host/content(/.*)?'
.br
.B restorecon -R -v /srv/myvmware_host_content

Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify labels that match multiple files.

.I The following file types are defined for vmware_host:


.EX
.PP
.B vmware_host_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the vmware_host_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the vmware_host_t domain.

.br
.TP 5
Paths:
/opt/vmware/(workstation|player)/bin/vmnet-natd, /opt/vmware/(workstation|player)/bin/vmnet-dhcpd, /opt/vmware/(workstation|player)/bin/vmware-nmbd, /opt/vmware/(workstation|player)/bin/vmware-smbd, /opt/vmware/(workstation|player)/bin/vmnet-bridge, /opt/vmware/(workstation|player)/bin/vmnet-netifup, /opt/vmware/(workstation|player)/bin/vmnet-sniffer, /opt/vmware/(workstation|player)/bin/vmware-smbpasswd, /opt/vmware/(workstation|player)/bin/vmware-smbpasswd\.bin, /usr/sbin/vmware-guest.*, /usr/lib/vmware-tools/sbin32/vmware.*, /usr/lib/vmware-tools/sbin64/vmware.*, /usr/bin/vmnet-natd, /usr/bin/vmware-vmx, /usr/bin/vmnet-dhcpd, /usr/bin/vmware-nmbd, /usr/bin/vmware-smbd, /usr/bin/vmnet-bridge, /usr/bin/vmnet-netifup, /usr/bin/vmnet-sniffer, /usr/bin/vmware-network, /usr/bin/vmware-smbpasswd, /usr/bin/vmware-smbpasswd\.bin, /usr/lib/vmware/bin/vmware-vmx

.EX
.PP
.B vmware_host_pid_t
.EE

- Set files with the vmware_host_pid_t type, if you want to store the vmware host files under the /run directory.


.EX
.PP
.B vmware_host_tmp_t
.EE

- Set files with the vmware_host_tmp_t type, if you want to store vmware host temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
