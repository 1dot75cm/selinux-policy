.SH "NAME"
cardmgr_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the cardmgr processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the cardmgr processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux cardmgr policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their cardmgr processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for cardmgr:


.EX
.B cardmgr_dev_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cardmgr_dev_t context, if you want to treat the files as cardmgr dev data.


.EX
.B cardmgr_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cardmgr_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the cardmgr_t domain.


.EX
.B cardmgr_lnk_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cardmgr_lnk_t context, if you want to treat the files as cardmgr lnk data.


.EX
.B cardmgr_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cardmgr_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the cardmgr files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.B cardmgr_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the cardmgr_var_run_t context, if you want to store the cardmgr files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
