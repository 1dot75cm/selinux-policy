.SH "NAME"
gpm_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the gpm processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the gpm processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux gpm policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their gpm processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for gpm:


.EX
.B gpm_conf_t 
.EE

- Set files with the gpm_conf_t context, if you want to treat the files as gpm configuration data.


.EX
.B gpm_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the gpm_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the gpm_t domain.


.EX
.B gpm_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the gpm_tmp_t context, if you want to store gpm temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B gpm_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the gpm_var_run_t context, if you want to store the gpm files under the /run directory.


.EX
.B gpmctl_t 
.EE

- Set files with the gpmctl_t context, if you want to treat the files as gpmctl data.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  gpm policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run gpm with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow usage of the gpg-agent --write-env-file option. This also allows gpg-agent to manage user files., you must turn on the gpg_agent_env_file boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P gpg_agent_env_file 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow httpd to run gpg in gpg-web domain, you must turn on the httpd_use_gpg boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P httpd_use_gpg 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow gpg web domain to modify public files used for public file transfer services., you must turn on the gpg_web_anon_write boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P gpg_web_anon_write 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
