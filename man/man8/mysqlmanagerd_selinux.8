.SH "NAME"
mysqlmanagerd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the mysqlmanagerd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the mysqlmanagerd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux mysqlmanagerd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their mysqlmanagerd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for mysqlmanagerd:


.EX
.B mysqlmanagerd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mysqlmanagerd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the mysqlmanagerd_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/usr/sbin/mysqlmanager

.EX
.B mysqlmanagerd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mysqlmanagerd_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the mysqlmanagerd_initrc_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/mysqlmanager

.EX
.B mysqlmanagerd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mysqlmanagerd_var_run_t context, if you want to store the mysqlmanagerd files under the /run directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/run/mysqld/mysqlmanager.*
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
