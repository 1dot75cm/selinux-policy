.SH "NAME"
lwregd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the lwregd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the lwregd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux lwregd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their lwregd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for lwregd:


.EX
.B lwregd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the lwregd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the lwregd_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B lwregd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the lwregd_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the lwregd files under the /var/lib directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/lib/likewise-open/db/registry\.db, /var/lib/likewise-open/regsd\.err
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B lwregd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the lwregd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the lwregd files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B lwregd_var_socket_t 
.EE

- Set files with the lwregd_var_socket_t type, if you want to treat the files as lwregd var socket data.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
