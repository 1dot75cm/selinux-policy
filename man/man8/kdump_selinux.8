.SH "NAME"
kdump_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the kdump processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the kdump processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux kdump policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their kdump processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for kdump:


.EX
.B kdump_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the kdump_etc_t context, if you want to store kdump files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.B kdump_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the kdump_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the kdump_t domain.


.EX
.B kdump_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the kdump_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the kdump_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B kdump_unit_file_t 
.EE

- Set files with the kdump_unit_file_t context, if you want to treat the files as kdump unit content.


.EX
.B kdumpgui_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the kdumpgui_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the kdumpgui_t domain.


.EX
.B kdumpgui_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the kdumpgui_tmp_t context, if you want to store kdumpgui temporary files in the /tmp directories.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
