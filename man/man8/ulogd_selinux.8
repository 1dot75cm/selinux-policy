.SH "NAME"
ulogd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the ulogd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the ulogd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux ulogd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ulogd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for ulogd:


.EX
.B ulogd_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ulogd_etc_t context, if you want to store ulogd files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.B ulogd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ulogd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the ulogd_t domain.


.EX
.B ulogd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ulogd_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the ulogd_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B ulogd_modules_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ulogd_modules_t context, if you want to treat the files as ulogd modules.


.EX
.B ulogd_var_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ulogd_var_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as ulogd var log data, usually stored in /var/log.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
