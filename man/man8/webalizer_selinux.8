.SH "NAME"
webalizer_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the webalizer processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the webalizer processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux webalizer policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their webalizer processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for webalizer:


.EX
.B webalizer_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the webalizer_etc_t type, if you want to store webalizer files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.B webalizer_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the webalizer_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the webalizer_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B webalizer_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the webalizer_tmp_t type, if you want to store webalizer temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B webalizer_usage_t 
.EE

- Set files with the webalizer_usage_t type, if you want to treat the files as webalizer usage data.


.EX
.B webalizer_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the webalizer_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the webalizer files under the /var/lib directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B webalizer_write_t 
.EE

- Set files with the webalizer_write_t type, if you want to treat the files as webalizer read/write content.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
