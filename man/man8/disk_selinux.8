.SH "NAME"
disk_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the disk processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the disk processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux disk policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their disk processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for disk:


.EX
.B disk_munin_plugin_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the disk_munin_plugin_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the disk_munin_plugin_t domain.


.EX
.B disk_munin_plugin_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the disk_munin_plugin_tmp_t context, if you want to store disk munin plugin temporary files in the /tmp directories.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
