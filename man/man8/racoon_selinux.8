.SH "NAME"
racoon_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the racoon processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the racoon processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The racoon processes execute with the racoon_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep racoon_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The racoon_t SELinux type can be entered via the \fBracoon_exec_t\fP file type.

The default entrypoint paths for the racoon_t domain are the following:

/usr/sbin/racoon
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux racoon policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their racoon processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for racoon:

.EX
.B racoon_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a racoon_t
can be used to make the process type racoon_t permissive. SELinux does not deny access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  racoon policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run racoon with the tightest access possible.

.EX
.B setsebool -P nscd_use_shm 1

.EE

.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.PP
If you want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd server for the racoon_t, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos for the racoon_t, you must turn on the kerberos_enabled boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P kerberos_enabled 1
.EE

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type racoon_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux racoon policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their racoon processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP

.PP
.B STANDARD FILE CONTEXT

SELinux defines the file context types for the racoon, if you wanted to
store files with these types in a diffent paths, you need to execute the semanage command to sepecify alternate labeling and then use restorecon to put the labels on disk.

.B semanage fcontext -a -t racoon_exec_t '/srv/racoon/content(/.*)?'
.br
.B restorecon -R -v /srv/myracoon_content

Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify labels that match multiple files.

.I The following file types are defined for racoon:


.EX
.PP
.B racoon_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the racoon_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the racoon_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B racoon_tmp_t
.EE

- Set files with the racoon_tmp_t type, if you want to store racoon temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
