.SH "NAME"
racoon_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the racoon processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the racoon processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  racoon policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run racoon with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow racoon to read shado, you must turn on the racoon_read_shadow boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P racoon_read_shadow 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux racoon policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their racoon processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for racoon:


.EX
.B racoon_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the racoon_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the racoon_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B racoon_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the racoon_tmp_t type, if you want to store racoon temporary files in the /tmp directories.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
