.SH "NAME"
acct_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the acct processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the acct processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux acct policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their acct processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for acct:


.EX
.B acct_data_t 
.EE

- Set files with the acct_data_t context, if you want to treat the files as acct content.


.EX
.B acct_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the acct_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the acct_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  acct policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run acct with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow ftp servers to login to local users and read/write all files on the system, governed by DAC, you must turn on the allow_ftpd_full_access boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P allow_ftpd_full_access 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow sftp-internal to login to local users and read/write all files on the system, governed by DAC, you must turn on the sftpd_full_access boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P sftpd_full_access 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
