.SH "NAME"
acct_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the acct processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the acct processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux acct policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their acct processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for acct:


.EX
.B acct_data_t 
.EE

- Set files with the acct_data_t context, if you want to treat the files as acct content.

.br
Paths: 
/var/log/account(/.*)?, /var/account(/.*)?

.EX
.B acct_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the acct_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the acct_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/accton, /sbin/accton, /etc/cron\.(daily|monthly)/acct
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
