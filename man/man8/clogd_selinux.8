.SH "NAME"
clogd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the clogd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the clogd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux clogd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their clogd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for clogd:


.EX
.B clogd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the clogd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the clogd_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/usr/sbin/clogd

.EX
.B clogd_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the clogd_tmpfs_t context, if you want to store clogd files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.B clogd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the clogd_var_run_t context, if you want to store the clogd files under the /run directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/run/clogd\.pid
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
