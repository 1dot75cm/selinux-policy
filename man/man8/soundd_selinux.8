.SH "NAME"
soundd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the soundd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the soundd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux soundd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their soundd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for soundd:


.EX
.B soundd_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the soundd_etc_t type, if you want to store soundd files in the /etc directories.

.br
Paths: 
/etc/yiff(/.*)?, /etc/nas(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B soundd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the soundd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the soundd_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/bin/gpe-soundserver, /usr/sbin/yiff, /usr/bin/nasd
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B soundd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the soundd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the soundd_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B soundd_state_t 
.EE

- Set files with the soundd_state_t type, if you want to treat the files as soundd state data.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B soundd_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the soundd_tmp_t type, if you want to store soundd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B soundd_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the soundd_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store soundd files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.B soundd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the soundd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the soundd files under the /run directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/run/nasd(/.*)?, /var/run/yiff-[0-9]+\.pid
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux soundd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their soundd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for soundd:
.EX

.B soundd_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 8000,9433,16001
.EE
.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
