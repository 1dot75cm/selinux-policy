.SH "NAME"
xfs_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the xfs processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the xfs processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux xfs policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their xfs processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for xfs:


.EX
.B xfs_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the xfs_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the xfs_t domain.


.EX
.B xfs_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the xfs_tmp_t context, if you want to store xfs temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B xfs_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the xfs_var_run_t context, if you want to store the xfs files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
