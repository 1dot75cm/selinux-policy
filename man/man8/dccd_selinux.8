.SH "NAME"
dccd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the dccd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the dccd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux dccd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their dccd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for dccd:


.EX
.B dccd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dccd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the dccd_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B dccd_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dccd_tmp_t type, if you want to store dccd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B dccd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dccd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the dccd files under the /run directory.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux dccd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their dccd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for dccd:
.EX

.B dcc_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B udp 6276,6277
.EE
.EX

.B dccm_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 5679
.EE
