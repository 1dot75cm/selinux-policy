.SH "NAME"
apm_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the apm processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the apm processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux apm policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their apm processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for apm:


.EX
.B apm_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the apm_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the apm_t domain.


.EX
.B apmd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the apmd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the apmd_t domain.


.EX
.B apmd_lock_t 
.EE

- Set files with the apmd_lock_t context, if you want to treat the files as apmd lock data.


.EX
.B apmd_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the apmd_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as apmd log data, usually stored in /var/log.


.EX
.B apmd_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the apmd_tmp_t context, if you want to store apmd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B apmd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the apmd_var_run_t context, if you want to store the apmd files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  apm policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run apm with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow users to login using a sssd serve, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow all daemons to use tcp wrappers, you must turn on the allow_daemons_use_tcp_wrapper boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P allow_daemons_use_tcp_wrapper 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow unconfined executables to make their heap memory executable.  Doing this is a really bad idea. Probably indicates a badly coded executable, but could indicate an attack. This executable should be reported in bugzill, you must turn on the allow_execheap boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P allow_execheap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow httpd to connect to the ldap por, you must turn on the httpd_can_connect_ldap boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P httpd_can_connect_ldap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to ignore vbetool mmap_zero errors, you must turn on the vbetool_mmap_zero_ignore boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P vbetool_mmap_zero_ignore 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow xend to run blktapctrl/tapdisk. Not required if using dedicated logical volumes for disk images, you must turn on the xend_run_blktap boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P xend_run_blktap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to control the ability to mmap a low area of the address space, as configured by /proc/sys/kernel/mmap_min_addr, you must turn on the mmap_low_allowed boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P mmap_low_allowed 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to ignore wine mmap_zero errors, you must turn on the wine_mmap_zero_ignore boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P wine_mmap_zero_ignore 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
