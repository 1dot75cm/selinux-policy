.SH "NAME"
corosync_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the corosync processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the corosync processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux corosync policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their corosync processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for corosync:


.EX
.B corosync_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the corosync_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the corosync_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/ccs_tool, /usr/sbin/corosync, /usr/sbin/corosync-notifyd, /usr/lib(64)?/heartbeat/heartbeat, /usr/sbin/cman_tool
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B corosync_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the corosync_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the corosync_initrc_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/heartbeat, /etc/rc\.d/init\.d/corosync
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B corosync_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the corosync_tmp_t type, if you want to store corosync temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B corosync_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the corosync_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store corosync files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.B corosync_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the corosync_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the corosync files under the /var/lib directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/lib/corosync(/.*)?, /usr/lib(64)?/heartbeat(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B corosync_var_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the corosync_var_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as corosync var log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B corosync_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the corosync_var_run_t type, if you want to store the corosync files under the /run directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/run/hearbeat(/.*)?, /var/run/corosync\.pid, /var/run/cman_.*
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.
