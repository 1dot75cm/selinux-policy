.SH "NAME"
cups_pdf_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the cups_pdf processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the cups_pdf processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The cups_pdf processes execute with the cups_pdf_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep cups_pdf_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The cups_pdf_t SELinux type can be entered via the \fBcups_pdf_exec_t\fP file type.

The default entrypoint paths for the cups_pdf_t domain are the following:

/usr/lib/cups/backend/cups-pdf
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux cups_pdf policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their cups_pdf processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for cups_pdf:

.EX
.B cups_pdf_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a cups_pdf_t
can be used to make the process type cups_pdf_t permissive. SELinux does not deny access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  cups_pdf policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run cups_pdf with the tightest access possible.

.EX
.B setsebool -P use_samba_home_dirs 1

.EE

.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.PP
If you want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd server for the cups_pdf_t, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos for the cups_pdf_t, you must turn on the kerberos_enabled boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P kerberos_enabled 1
.EE

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type cups_pdf_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B anon_inodefs_t


.br
.B cifs_t


.br
.B cups_pdf_tmp_t

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux cups_pdf policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their cups_pdf processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP

.PP
.B STANDARD FILE CONTEXT

SELinux defines the file context types for the cups_pdf, if you wanted to
store files with these types in a diffent paths, you need to execute the semanage command to sepecify alternate labeling and then use restorecon to put the labels on disk.

.B semanage fcontext -a -t cups_pdf_exec_t '/srv/cups_pdf/content(/.*)?'
.br
.B restorecon -R -v /srv/mycups_pdf_content

Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify labels that match multiple files.

.I The following file types are defined for cups_pdf:


.EX
.PP
.B cups_pdf_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the cups_pdf_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the cups_pdf_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B cups_pdf_tmp_t
.EE

- Set files with the cups_pdf_tmp_t type, if you want to store cups pdf temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
