.SH "NAME"
zoneminder_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the zoneminder processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the zoneminder processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux zoneminder policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their zoneminder processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for zoneminder:


.EX
.B zoneminder_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the zoneminder_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the zoneminder_t domain.


.EX
.B zoneminder_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the zoneminder_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the zoneminder_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B zoneminder_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the zoneminder_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as zoneminder log data, usually stored in /var/log.


.EX
.B zoneminder_spool_t 
.EE

- Set files with the zoneminder_spool_t context, if you want to store the zoneminder files in the /var/spool directories.


.EX
.B zoneminder_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the zoneminder_tmpfs_t context, if you want to store zoneminder files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.B zoneminder_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the zoneminder_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the zoneminder files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.B zoneminder_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the zoneminder_var_run_t context, if you want to store the zoneminder files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  zoneminder policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run zoneminder with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow ZoneMinder to modify public files used for public file transfer services., you must turn on the zoneminder_anon_write boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P zoneminder_anon_write 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
