.SH "NAME"
uml_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the uml processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the uml processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux uml policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their uml processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for uml:


.EX
.B uml_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uml_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the uml_t domain.


.EX
.B uml_ro_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uml_ro_t context, if you want to treat the files as uml read/only content.


.EX
.B uml_rw_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uml_rw_t context, if you want to treat the files as uml read/write content.


.EX
.B uml_switch_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uml_switch_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the uml_switch_t domain.


.EX
.B uml_switch_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uml_switch_var_run_t context, if you want to store the uml switch files under the /run directory.


.EX
.B uml_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uml_tmp_t context, if you want to store uml temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B uml_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uml_tmpfs_t context, if you want to store uml files on a tmpfs file system.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  uml policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run uml with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow all daemons to write corefiles to , you must turn on the allow_daemons_dump_core boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P allow_daemons_dump_core 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
