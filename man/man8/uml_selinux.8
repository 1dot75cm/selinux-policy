.SH "NAME"
uml_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the uml processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the uml processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux uml policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their uml processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for uml:


.EX
.B uml_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uml_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the uml_t domain.


.EX
.B uml_ro_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uml_ro_t type, if you want to treat the files as uml read/only content.


.EX
.B uml_rw_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uml_rw_t type, if you want to treat the files as uml read/write content.


.EX
.B uml_switch_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uml_switch_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the uml_switch_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B uml_switch_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uml_switch_var_run_t type, if you want to store the uml switch files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B uml_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uml_tmp_t type, if you want to store uml temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B uml_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the uml_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store uml files on a tmpfs file system.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
