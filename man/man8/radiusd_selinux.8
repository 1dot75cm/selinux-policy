.SH "NAME"
radiusd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the radiusd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the radiusd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux radiusd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their radiusd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for radiusd:


.EX
.B radiusd_etc_rw_t 
.EE

- Set files with the radiusd_etc_rw_t context, if you want to treat the files as radiusd etc read/write content.


.EX
.B radiusd_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the radiusd_etc_t context, if you want to store radiusd files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.B radiusd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the radiusd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the radiusd_t domain.


.EX
.B radiusd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the radiusd_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the radiusd_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B radiusd_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the radiusd_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as radiusd log data, usually stored in /var/log.


.EX
.B radiusd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the radiusd_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the radiusd files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.B radiusd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the radiusd_var_run_t context, if you want to store the radiusd files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  radiusd policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run radiusd with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow users to login using a radius serve, you must turn on the authlogin_radius boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P authlogin_radius 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
