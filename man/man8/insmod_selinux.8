.SH "NAME"
insmod_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the insmod processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the insmod processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux insmod policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their insmod processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for insmod:


.EX
.B insmod_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the insmod_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the insmod_t domain.


.EX
.B insmod_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the insmod_tmpfs_t context, if you want to store insmod files on a tmpfs file system.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  insmod policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run insmod with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to disallow programs and users from transitioning to insmod domain, you must turn on the secure_mode_insmod boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P secure_mode_insmod 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow pppd to load kernel modules for certain modem, you must turn on the pppd_can_insmod boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P pppd_can_insmod 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
