.SH "NAME"
clamd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the clamd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the clamd processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The clamd processes execute with the clamd_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep clamd_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The clamd_t SELinux type can be entered via the \fBclamd_exec_t\fP file type.

The default entrypoint paths for the clamd_t domain are the following:

/usr/sbin/clamd, /usr/sbin/clamav-milter
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux clamd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their clamd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for clamd:

.EX
.B clamd_t, clamscan_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a clamd_t
can be used to make the process type clamd_t permissive. SELinux does not deny access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  clamd policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run clamd with the tightest access possible.

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux clamd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their clamd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP

.PP
.B STANDARD FILE CONTEXT

SELinux defines the file context types for the clamd, if you wanted to
store files with these types in a diffent paths, you need to execute the semanage command to sepecify alternate labeling and then use restorecon to put the labels on disk.

.B semanage fcontext -a -t clamd_etc_t '/srv/clamd/content(/.*)?'
.br
.B restorecon -R -v /srv/myclamd_content

Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify labels that match multiple files.

.I The following file types are defined for clamd:


.EX
.PP
.B clamd_etc_t
.EE

- Set files with the clamd_etc_t type, if you want to store clamd files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.PP
.B clamd_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the clamd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the clamd_t domain.

.br
.TP 5
Paths:
/usr/sbin/clamd, /usr/sbin/clamav-milter

.EX
.PP
.B clamd_initrc_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the clamd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the clamd_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B clamd_tmp_t
.EE

- Set files with the clamd_tmp_t type, if you want to store clamd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B clamd_unit_file_t
.EE

- Set files with the clamd_unit_file_t type, if you want to treat the files as clamd unit content.


.EX
.PP

Paths:
/var/log/clamd.*, /var/log/clamav.*

.EX
.PP
.B clamd_var_run_t

.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage port
can also be used to manipulate the port definitions

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans
