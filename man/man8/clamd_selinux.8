.SH "NAME"
clamd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the clamd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the clamd processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The clamd processes execute with the clamd_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep clamd_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The clamd_t SELinux type can be entered via the "clamd_exec_t" file type.  The default entrypoint paths for the clamd_t domain are the following:"

/usr/sbin/clamd, /usr/sbin/clamav-milter
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux clamd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their clamd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for clamd:

.EX
.B clamd_t, clamscan_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  clamd policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run clamd with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow clamd to use JIT compiler, you must turn on the clamd_use_jit boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P clamd_use_jit 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow clamscan to non security files on a system, you must turn on the clamscan_can_scan_system boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P clamscan_can_scan_system 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow clamscan to read user content, you must turn on the clamscan_read_user_content boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P clamscan_read_user_content 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow clamd to use JIT compiler, you must turn on the clamd_use_jit boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P clamd_use_jit 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow clamscan to non security files on a system, you must turn on the clamscan_can_scan_system boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P clamscan_can_scan_system 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow clamscan to read user content, you must turn on the clamscan_read_user_content boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P clamscan_read_user_content 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux clamd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their clamd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following file types are defined for clamd:


.EX
.PP
.B clamd_etc_t
.EE

- Set files with the clamd_etc_t type, if you want to store clamd files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.PP
.B clamd_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the clamd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the clamd_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B clamd_initrc_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the clamd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the clamd_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B clamd_tmp_t
.EE

- Set files with the clamd_tmp_t type, if you want to store clamd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B clamd_unit_file_t
.EE

- Set files with the clamd_unit_file_t type, if you want to treat the files as clamd unit content.


.EX
.PP
.B clamd_var_lib_t
.EE

- Set files with the clamd_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the clamd files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.PP
.B clamd_var_log_t
.EE

- Set files with the clamd_var_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as clamd var log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.PP
.B clamd_var_run_t
.EE

- Set files with the clamd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the clamd files under the /run directory.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports.
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command:

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports.
SELinux clamd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their clamd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following port types are defined for clamd:

.EX
.TP 5
.B clamd_port_t
.TP 10
.EE


Default Defined Ports:
tcp 3310
.EE
.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type clamd_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B amavis_spool_t

	/var/spool/amavisd(/.*)?

.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.PP
If you want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd serve for the clamd_t, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos for the clamd_t, you must turn on the kerberos_enabled boolean.
