.SH "NAME"
clamd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the clamd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the clamd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux clamd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their clamd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for clamd:


.EX
.B clamd_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the clamd_etc_t context, if you want to store clamd files in the /etc directories.

.br
Path: 
/etc/clamav(/.*)?

.EX
.B clamd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the clamd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the clamd_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/clamd, /usr/sbin/clamav-milter

.EX
.B clamd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the clamd_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the clamd_initrc_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/clamd-wrapper

.EX
.B clamd_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the clamd_tmp_t context, if you want to store clamd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B clamd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the clamd_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the clamd files under the /var/lib directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/lib/clamd.*, /var/clamav(/.*)?, /var/lib/clamav(/.*)?

.EX
.B clamd_var_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the clamd_var_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as clamd var log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/log/clamav.*, /var/log/clamd.*

.EX
.B clamd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the clamd_var_run_t context, if you want to store the clamd files under the /run directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/run/amavis(d)?/clamd\.pid, /var/run/clamd.*, /var/run/clamav.*, /var/spool/MailScanner(/.*)?, /var/spool/amavisd/clamd\.sock
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  clamd policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run clamd with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow clamscan to read user conten, you must turn on the clamscan_read_user_content boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P clamscan_read_user_content 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow clamd to use JIT compile, you must turn on the clamd_use_jit boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P clamd_use_jit 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
