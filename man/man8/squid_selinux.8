.SH "NAME"
squid_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the squid processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the squid processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  squid policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run squid with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow squid to run as a transparent proxy (TPROXY, you must turn on the squid_use_tproxy boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P squid_use_tproxy 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow squid to connect to all ports, not just HTTP, FTP, and Gopher ports, you must turn on the squid_connect_any boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P squid_connect_any 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux squid policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their squid processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for squid:


.EX
.B squid_cache_t 
.EE

- Set files with the squid_cache_t type, if you want to store the files under the /var/cache directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/cache/squid(/.*)?, /var/spool/squid(/.*)?, /var/squidGuard(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B squid_conf_t 
.EE

- Set files with the squid_conf_t type, if you want to treat the files as squid configuration data, usually stored under the /etc directory.

.br
Paths: 
/etc/squid(/.*)?, /usr/share/squid(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B squid_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the squid_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the squid_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B squid_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the squid_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the squid_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B squid_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the squid_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as squid log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/log/squid(/.*)?, /var/log/squidGuard(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B squid_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the squid_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store squid files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.B squid_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the squid_var_run_t type, if you want to store the squid files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux squid policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their squid processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for squid:
.EX

.B squid_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 3128,3401,4827
.EE
.B udp 3401,4827
.EE
.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
