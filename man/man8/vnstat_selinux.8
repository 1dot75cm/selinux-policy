.SH "NAME"
vnstat_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the vnstat processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the vnstat processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux vnstat policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their vnstat processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for vnstat:


.EX
.B vnstat_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the vnstat_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the vnstat_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B vnstatd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the vnstatd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the vnstatd_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B vnstatd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the vnstatd_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the vnstatd files under the /var/lib directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B vnstatd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the vnstatd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the vnstatd files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
