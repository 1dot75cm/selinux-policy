.SH "NAME"
spamd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the spamd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the spamd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux spamd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their spamd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for spamd:


.EX
.B spamd_compiled_t 
.EE

- Set files with the spamd_compiled_t context, if you want to treat the files as spamd compiled data.

.br
Path: 
/var/lib/spamassassin/compiled(/.*)?

.EX
.B spamd_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the spamd_etc_t context, if you want to store spamd files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.B spamd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the spamd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the spamd_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/spamd, /usr/bin/mimedefang-multiplexor, /usr/bin/spamd, /usr/bin/mimedefang

.EX
.B spamd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the spamd_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the spamd_initrc_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/spamd, /etc/rc\.d/init\.d/mimedefang.*

.EX
.B spamd_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the spamd_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as spamd log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/log/spamd\.log, /var/log/mimedefang

.EX
.B spamd_spool_t 
.EE

- Set files with the spamd_spool_t context, if you want to store the spamd files under the /var/spool directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/spool/spamd(/.*)?, /var/spool/spamassassin(/.*)?

.EX
.B spamd_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the spamd_tmp_t context, if you want to store spamd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B spamd_update_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the spamd_update_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the spamd_update_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/usr/bin/sa-update

.EX
.B spamd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the spamd_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the spamd files under the /var/lib directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/lib/spamassassin(/.*)?

.EX
.B spamd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the spamd_var_run_t context, if you want to store the spamd files under the /run directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/run/spamassassin(/.*)?, /var/spool/MIMEDefang(/.*)?, /var/spool/MD-Quarantine(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  spamd policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run spamd with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow user spamassassin clients to use the network, you must turn on the spamassassin_can_network boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P spamassassin_can_network 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow spamd to read/write user home directories, you must turn on the spamd_enable_home_dirs boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P spamd_enable_home_dirs 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow http daemon to check spa, you must turn on the httpd_can_check_spam boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P httpd_can_check_spam 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
