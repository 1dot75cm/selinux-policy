.SH "NAME"
alsa_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the alsa processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the alsa processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The alsa processes execute with the alsa_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep alsa_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The alsa_t SELinux type can be entered via the \fBalsa_exec_t\fP file type.

The default entrypoint paths for the alsa_t domain are the following:

/sbin/salsa, /sbin/alsactl, /usr/bin/ainit, /bin/alsaunmute, /usr/sbin/salsa, /usr/sbin/alsactl, /usr/bin/alsaunmute
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux alsa policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their alsa processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for alsa:

.EX
.B alsa_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a alsa_t
can be used to make the process type alsa_t permissive. SELinux does not deny access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  alsa policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run alsa with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd server, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean. Disabled by default.

.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.PP
If you want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd server for the alsa_t, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean.

.EX

.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos for the alsa_t, you must turn on the kerberos_enabled boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P kerberos_enabled 1
.EE

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type alsa_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B alsa_etc_rw_t

	/etc/asound(/.*)?
.br
	/etc/alsa/pcm(/.*)?
.br
	/usr/share/alsa/pcm(/.*)?
.br
	/etc/asound\.state
.br
	/etc/alsa/asound\.state
.br
	/usr/share/alsa/alsa\.conf
.br

.br
.B alsa_tmp_t


.br
.B alsa_var_lib_t

	/var/lib/alsa(/.*)?
.br

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux alsa policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their alsa processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP

.PP
.B STANDARD FILE CONTEXT

SELinux defines the file context types for the alsa, if you wanted to
store files with these types in a diffent paths, you need to execute the semanage command to sepecify alternate labeling and then use restorecon to put the labels on disk.

.B semanage fcontext -a -t alsa_etc_rw_t '/srv/alsa/content(/.*)?'
.br
.B restorecon -R -v /srv/myalsa_content

Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify labels that match multiple files.

.I The following file types are defined for alsa:


.EX
.PP
.B alsa_etc_rw_t
.EE

- Set files with the alsa_etc_rw_t type, if you want to treat the files as alsa etc read/write content.

.br
.TP 5
Paths:
/etc/asound(/.*)?, /etc/alsa/pcm(/.*)?, /usr/share/alsa/pcm(/.*)?, /etc/asound\.state, /etc/alsa/asound\.state, /usr/share/alsa/alsa\.conf

.EX
.PP
.B alsa_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the alsa_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the alsa_t domain.

.br
.TP 5
Paths:
/sbin/salsa, /sbin/alsactl, /usr/bin/ainit, /bin/alsaunmute, /usr/sbin/salsa, /usr/sbin/alsactl, /usr/bin/alsaunmute

.EX
.PP
.B alsa_home_t
.EE

- Set files with the alsa_home_t type, if you want to store alsa files in the users home directory.

.br
.TP 5
Paths:
/home/[^/]*/\.asoundrc, /home/pwalsh/\.asoundrc, /home/dwalsh/\.asoundrc, /var/lib/xguest/home/xguest/\.asoundrc

.EX
.PP
.B alsa_tmp_t
.EE

- Set files with the alsa_tmp_t type, if you want to store alsa temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B alsa_unit_file_t
.EE

- Set files with the alsa_unit_file_t type, if you want to treat the files as alsa unit content.


.EX
.PP
.B alsa_var_lib_t
.EE

- Set files with the alsa_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the alsa files under the /var/lib directory.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
