.SH "NAME"
alsa_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the alsa processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the alsa processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux alsa policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their alsa processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for alsa:


.EX
.B alsa_etc_rw_t 
.EE

- Set files with the alsa_etc_rw_t type, if you want to treat the files as alsa etc read/write content.

.br
Paths: 
/etc/alsa/pcm(/.*)?, /etc/alsa/asound\.state, /usr/share/alsa/pcm(/.*)?, /etc/asound\.state, /etc/asound(/.*)?, /usr/share/alsa/alsa\.conf
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B alsa_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the alsa_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the alsa_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/salsa, /bin/alsaunmute, /sbin/alsactl, /usr/bin/ainit, /usr/bin/alsaunmute, /sbin/salsa, /usr/sbin/alsactl
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B alsa_home_t 
.EE

- Set files with the alsa_home_t type, if you want to store alsa files in the users home directory.


.EX
.B alsa_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the alsa_tmp_t type, if you want to store alsa temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B alsa_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the alsa_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the alsa files under the /var/lib directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
