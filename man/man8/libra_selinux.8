.SH "NAME"
libra_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the libra processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the libra processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux libra policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their libra processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for libra:


.EX
.B libra_cgroup_read_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the libra_cgroup_read_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the libra_cgroup_read_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B libra_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the libra_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the libra_initrc_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/bin/rhc-restorer, /etc/rc\.d/init\.d/mcollective, /etc/rc\.d/init\.d/libra
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B libra_initrc_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the libra_initrc_tmp_t type, if you want to store libra initrc temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B libra_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the libra_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as libra log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B libra_mail_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the libra_mail_tmp_t type, if you want to store libra mail temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B libra_private_file_t 
.EE

- Set files with the libra_private_file_t type, if you want to treat the files as libra private content.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B libra_rw_file_t 
.EE

- Set files with the libra_rw_file_t type, if you want to treat the files as libra rw content.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B libra_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the libra_tmp_t type, if you want to store libra temporary files in the /tmp directories.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B libra_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the libra_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the libra files under the /var/lib directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B libra_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the libra_var_run_t type, if you want to store the libra files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux libra policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their libra processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for libra:
.EX

.B libra_port_t 
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
