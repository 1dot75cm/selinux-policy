.SH "NAME"
ypbind_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the ypbind processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the ypbind processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux ypbind policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ypbind processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for ypbind:


.EX
.B ypbind_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ypbind_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the ypbind_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/ypbind, /sbin/ypbind

.EX
.B ypbind_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ypbind_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the ypbind_initrc_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/ypbind

.EX
.B ypbind_unit_file_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ypbind_unit_file_t context, if you want to treat the files as ypbind unit content.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/lib/systemd/system/ypbind\.service, /lib/systemd/system/ypbind\.service

.EX
.B ypbind_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ypbind_var_run_t context, if you want to store the ypbind files under the /run directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/run/ypbind.*
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  ypbind policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run ypbind with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow system to run with NI, you must turn on the allow_ypbind boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P allow_ypbind 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
