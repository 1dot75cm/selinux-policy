.SH "NAME"
games_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the games processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the games processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux games policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their games processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for games:


.EX
.B games_data_t 
.EE

- Set files with the games_data_t context, if you want to treat the files as games content.


.EX
.B games_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the games_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the games_t domain.


.EX
.B games_srv_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the games_srv_var_run_t context, if you want to store the games srv files under the /run directory.


.EX
.B games_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the games_tmp_t context, if you want to store games temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B games_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the games_tmpfs_t context, if you want to store games files on a tmpfs file system.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
