.SH "NAME"
mscan_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the mscan processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the mscan processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux mscan policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their mscan processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for mscan:


.EX
.B mscan_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mscan_etc_t context, if you want to store mscan files in the /etc directories.

.br
Paths: 
/etc/sysconfig/MailScanner, /etc/MailScanner(/.*)?, /etc/sysconfig/update_spamassassin

.EX
.B mscan_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mscan_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the mscan_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/usr/sbin/MailScanner

.EX
.B mscan_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mscan_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the mscan_initrc_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/MailScanner

.EX
.B mscan_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mscan_tmp_t context, if you want to store mscan temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B mscan_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mscan_var_run_t context, if you want to store the mscan files under the /run directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/run/MailScanner\.pid
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  mscan policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run mscan with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow clamscan to read user conten, you must turn on the clamscan_read_user_content boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P clamscan_read_user_content 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
