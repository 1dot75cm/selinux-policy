.SH "NAME"
passwd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the passwd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the passwd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux passwd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their passwd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for passwd:


.EX
.B passwd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the passwd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the passwd_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/bin/passwd, /usr/bin/chage
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B passwd_file_t 
.EE

- Set files with the passwd_file_t type, if you want to treat the files as passwd content.

.br
Paths: 
/etc/passwd\.OLD, /etc/ptmptmp, /etc/passwd-?, /etc/group-?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
