.SH "NAME"
ddclient_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the ddclient processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the ddclient processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux ddclient policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ddclient processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for ddclient:


.EX
.B ddclient_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ddclient_etc_t context, if you want to store ddclient files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.B ddclient_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ddclient_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the ddclient_t domain.


.EX
.B ddclient_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ddclient_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the ddclient_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B ddclient_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ddclient_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as ddclient log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.B ddclient_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ddclient_tmp_t context, if you want to store ddclient temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B ddclient_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ddclient_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the ddclient files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.B ddclient_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ddclient_var_run_t context, if you want to store the ddclient files under the /run directory.


.EX
.B ddclient_var_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ddclient_var_t context, if you want to store the ddcl files under the /var directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
