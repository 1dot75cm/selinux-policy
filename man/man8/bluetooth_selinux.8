.SH "NAME"
bluetooth_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the bluetooth processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the bluetooth processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux bluetooth policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their bluetooth processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for bluetooth:


.EX
.B bluetooth_conf_rw_t 
.EE

- Set files with the bluetooth_conf_rw_t context, if you want to treat the files as bluetooth conf read/write content.


.EX
.B bluetooth_conf_t 
.EE

- Set files with the bluetooth_conf_t context, if you want to treat the files as bluetooth configuration data.


.EX
.B bluetooth_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the bluetooth_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the bluetooth_t domain.


.EX
.B bluetooth_helper_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the bluetooth_helper_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the bluetooth_helper_t domain.


.EX
.B bluetooth_helper_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the bluetooth_helper_tmp_t context, if you want to store bluetooth helper temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B bluetooth_helper_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the bluetooth_helper_tmpfs_t context, if you want to store bluetooth helper files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.B bluetooth_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the bluetooth_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the bluetooth_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B bluetooth_lock_t 
.EE

- Set files with the bluetooth_lock_t context, if you want to treat the files as bluetooth lock data.


.EX
.B bluetooth_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the bluetooth_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the bluetooth files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.B bluetooth_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the bluetooth_var_run_t context, if you want to store the bluetooth files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  bluetooth policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run bluetooth with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow xguest users to use blue tooth devices, you must turn on the xguest_use_bluetooth boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P xguest_use_bluetooth 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
