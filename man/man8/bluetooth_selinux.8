.SH "NAME"
bluetooth_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the bluetooth processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the bluetooth processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  bluetooth policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run bluetooth with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow xguest to use blue tooth devices, you must turn on the xguest_use_bluetooth boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P xguest_use_bluetooth 1
.EE

.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.PP
If you want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd serve for the bluetooth_t, bluetooth_helper_t, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos for the bluetooth_t, bluetooth_helper_t, you must turn on the kerberos_enabled boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P kerberos_enabled 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux bluetooth policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their bluetooth processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for bluetooth:


.EX
.PP
.B bluetooth_conf_rw_t 
.EE

- Set files with the bluetooth_conf_rw_t type, if you want to treat the files as bluetooth conf read/write content.


.EX
.PP
.B bluetooth_conf_t 
.EE

- Set files with the bluetooth_conf_t type, if you want to treat the files as bluetooth configuration data, usually stored under the /etc directory.


.EX
.PP
.B bluetooth_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the bluetooth_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the bluetooth_t domain.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/hcid, /usr/bin/rfcomm, /usr/sbin/sdpd, /usr/bin/hidd, /usr/sbin/bluetoothd, /usr/sbin/hid2hci, /usr/bin/dund, /usr/sbin/hciattach

.EX
.PP
.B bluetooth_helper_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the bluetooth_helper_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the bluetooth_helper_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B bluetooth_helper_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the bluetooth_helper_tmp_t type, if you want to store bluetooth helper temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B bluetooth_helper_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the bluetooth_helper_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store bluetooth helper files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.PP
.B bluetooth_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the bluetooth_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the bluetooth_initrc_t domain.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/dund, /etc/rc\.d/init\.d/bluetooth, /etc/rc\.d/init\.d/pand

.EX
.PP
.B bluetooth_lock_t 
.EE

- Set files with the bluetooth_lock_t type, if you want to treat the files as bluetooth lock data, stored under the /var/lock directory


.EX
.PP
.B bluetooth_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the bluetooth_tmp_t type, if you want to store bluetooth temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B bluetooth_unit_file_t 
.EE

- Set files with the bluetooth_unit_file_t type, if you want to treat the files as bluetooth unit content.


.EX
.PP
.B bluetooth_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the bluetooth_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the bluetooth files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.PP
.B bluetooth_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the bluetooth_var_run_t type, if you want to store the bluetooth files under the /run directory.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/var/run/bluetoothd_address, /var/run/sdp

.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. 
SELinux bluetooth policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their bluetooth processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following process types are defined for bluetooth:

.EX
.B bluetooth_helper_t, bluetooth_t 
.EE
.PP
Note: 
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE 
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux user type bluetooth_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B bluetooth_conf_rw_t

	/etc/bluetooth/link_key
.br

.br
.B bluetooth_lock_t


.br
.B bluetooth_tmp_t


.br
.B bluetooth_var_lib_t

	/var/lib/bluetooth(/.*)?
.br

.br
.B bluetooth_var_run_t

	/var/run/sdp
.br
	/var/run/bluetoothd_address
.br

.br
.B usbfs_t


.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
