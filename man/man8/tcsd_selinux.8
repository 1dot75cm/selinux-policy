.SH "NAME"
tcsd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the tcsd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the tcsd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux tcsd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their tcsd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for tcsd:


.EX
.B tcsd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tcsd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the tcsd_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B tcsd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tcsd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the tcsd_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B tcsd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tcsd_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the tcsd files under the /var/lib directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux tcsd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their tcsd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for tcsd:
.EX

.B tcs_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 30003
.EE
.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
