.SH "NAME"
tcsd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the tcsd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the tcsd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux tcsd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their tcsd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for tcsd:


.EX
.B tcsd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tcsd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the tcsd_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/usr/sbin/tcsd

.EX
.B tcsd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tcsd_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the tcsd_initrc_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/tcsd

.EX
.B tcsd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the tcsd_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the tcsd files under the /var/lib directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/lib/tpm(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
