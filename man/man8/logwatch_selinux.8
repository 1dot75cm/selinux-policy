.SH "NAME"
logwatch_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the logwatch processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the logwatch processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux logwatch policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their logwatch processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for logwatch:


.EX
.B logwatch_cache_t 
.EE

- Set files with the logwatch_cache_t context, if you want to store the files under the /var/cache directory.


.EX
.B logwatch_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the logwatch_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the logwatch_t domain.


.EX
.B logwatch_lock_t 
.EE

- Set files with the logwatch_lock_t context, if you want to treat the files as logwatch lock data, stored under the /var/lock directory


.EX
.B logwatch_mail_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the logwatch_mail_tmp_t context, if you want to store logwatch mail temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B logwatch_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the logwatch_tmp_t context, if you want to store logwatch temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B logwatch_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the logwatch_var_run_t context, if you want to store the logwatch files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
