.SH "NAME"
logwatch_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the logwatch processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the logwatch processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The logwatch processes execute with the logwatch_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep logwatch_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The logwatch_t SELinux type can be entered via the \fBlogwatch_exec_t\fP file type.

The default entrypoint paths for the logwatch_t domain are the following:

/usr/sbin/epylog, /usr/sbin/logcheck, /usr/sbin/logwatch\.pl, /usr/share/logwatch/scripts/logwatch\.pl
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux logwatch policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their logwatch processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for logwatch:

.EX
.B logwatch_t, logwatch_mail_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a logwatch_t
can be used to make the process type logwatch_t permissive. SELinux does not deny access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  logwatch policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run logwatch with the tightest access possible.

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type logwatch_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B logwatch_cache_t

	/var/lib/epylog(/.*)?
.br
	/var/lib/logcheck(/.*)?
.br
	/var/cache/logwatch(/.*)?
.br

.br
.B logwatch_lock_t

	/var/lock/logcheck.*
.br

.br
.B logwatch_tmp_t


.br
.B logwatch_var_run_t

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux logwatch policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their logwatch processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP

.PP
.B STANDARD FILE CONTEXT

SELinux defines the file context types for the logwatch, if you wanted to
store files with these types in a diffent paths, you need to execute the semanage command to sepecify alternate labeling and then use restorecon to put the labels on disk.

.B semanage fcontext -a -t logwatch_cache_t '/srv/logwatch/content(/.*)?'
.br
.B restorecon -R -v /srv/mylogwatch_content

Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify labels that match multiple files.

.I The following file types are defined for logwatch:


.EX
.PP
.B logwatch_cache_t
.EE

- Set files with the logwatch_cache_t type, if you want to store the files under the /var/cache directory.

.br
.TP 5
Paths:
/var/lib/epylog(/.*)?, /var/lib/logcheck(/.*)?, /var/cache/logwatch(/.*)?

.EX
.PP
.B logwatch_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the logwatch_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the logwatch_t domain.

.br
.TP 5
Paths:
/usr/sbin/epylog, /usr/sbin/logcheck, /usr/sbin/logwatch\.pl, /usr/share/logwatch/scripts/logwatch\.pl

.EX
.PP
.B logwatch_lock_t
.EE

- Set files with the logwatch_lock_t type, if you want to treat the files as logwatch lock data, stored under the /var/lock directory


.EX
.PP
.B logwatch_mail_tmp_t
.EE

- Set files with the logwatch_mail_tmp_t type, if you want to store logwatch mail temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B logwatch_tmp_t
.EE

- Set files with the logwatch_tmp_t type, if you want to store logwatch temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B logwatch_var_run_t
.EE

- Set files with the logwatch_var_run_t type, if you want to store the logwatch files under the /run or /var/run directory.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
