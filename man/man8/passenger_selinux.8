.SH "NAME"
passenger_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the passenger processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the passenger processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux passenger policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their passenger processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for passenger:


.EX
.B passenger_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the passenger_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the passenger_t domain.


.EX
.B passenger_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the passenger_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as passenger log data, usually stored in /var/log.


.EX
.B passenger_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the passenger_tmp_t context, if you want to store passenger temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B passenger_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the passenger_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the passenger files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.B passenger_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the passenger_var_run_t context, if you want to store the passenger files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
