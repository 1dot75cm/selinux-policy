.SH "NAME"
l2tpd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the l2tpd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the l2tpd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux l2tpd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their l2tpd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for l2tpd:


.EX
.B l2tpd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the l2tpd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the l2tpd_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/xl2tpd, /usr/sbin/openl2tpd
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B l2tpd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the l2tpd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the l2tpd_initrc_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/xl2tpd, /etc/rc\.d/init\.d/openl2tpd
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B l2tpd_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the l2tpd_tmp_t type, if you want to store l2tpd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B l2tpd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the l2tpd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the l2tpd files under the /run directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/run/xl2tpd(/.*)?, /var/run/xl2tpd\.pid
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
