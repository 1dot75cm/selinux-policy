.SH "NAME"
l2tpd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the l2tpd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the l2tpd processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The l2tpd processes execute with the l2tpd_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep l2tpd_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The l2tpd_t SELinux type can be entered via the "l2tpd_exec_t" file type.  The default entrypoint paths for the l2tpd_t domain are the following:"

/usr/sbin/xl2tpd, /usr/sbin/prol2tpd, /usr/sbin/openl2tpd
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux l2tpd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their l2tpd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for l2tpd:

.EX
.B l2tpd_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux l2tpd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their l2tpd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following file types are defined for l2tpd:


.EX
.PP
.B l2tpd_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the l2tpd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the l2tpd_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B l2tpd_initrc_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the l2tpd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the l2tpd_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B l2tpd_tmp_t
.EE

- Set files with the l2tpd_tmp_t type, if you want to store l2tpd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B l2tpd_var_run_t
.EE

- Set files with the l2tpd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the l2tpd files under the /run directory.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports.
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command:

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports.
SELinux l2tpd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their l2tpd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following port types are defined for l2tpd:

.EX
.TP 5
.B l2tp_port_t
.TP 10
.EE


Default Defined Ports:
tcp 1701
.EE
udp 1701
.EE
.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type l2tpd_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B l2tpd_var_run_t

	/var/run/xl2tpd(/.*)?
.br
	/var/run/prol2tpd(/.*)?
.br
	/var/run/xl2tpd\.pid
.br
	/var/run/prol2tpd\.ctl
.br
	/var/run/prol2tpd\.pid
.br
	/var/run/openl2tpd\.pid
.br
