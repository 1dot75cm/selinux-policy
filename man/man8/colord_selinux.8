.SH "NAME"
colord_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the colord processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the colord processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux colord policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their colord processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for colord:


.EX
.B colord_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the colord_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the colord_t domain.


.EX
.B colord_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the colord_tmp_t context, if you want to store colord temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B colord_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the colord_tmpfs_t context, if you want to store colord files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.B colord_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the colord_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the colord files under the /var/lib directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
