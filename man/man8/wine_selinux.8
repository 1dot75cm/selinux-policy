.SH "NAME"
wine_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the wine processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the wine processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux wine policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their wine processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for wine:


.EX
.B wine_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the wine_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the wine_t domain.


.EX
.B wine_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the wine_tmp_t context, if you want to store wine temporary files in the /tmp directories.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  wine policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run wine with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow Apache to use mod_auth_ntlm_winbind, you must turn on the allow_httpd_mod_auth_ntlm_winbind boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P allow_httpd_mod_auth_ntlm_winbind 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to ignore wine mmap_zero errors., you must turn on the wine_mmap_zero_ignore boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P wine_mmap_zero_ignore 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
