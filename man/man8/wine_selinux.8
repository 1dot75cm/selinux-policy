.SH "NAME"
wine_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the wine processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the wine processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The wine processes execute with the wine_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep wine_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The wine_t SELinux type can be entered via the "wine_exec_t" file type.  The default entrypoint paths for the wine_t domain are the following:"

/usr/bin/wine.*, /opt/teamviewer(/.*)?/bin/wine.*, /opt/google/picasa(/.*)?/bin/wdi, /opt/google/picasa(/.*)?/bin/wine.*, /opt/google/picasa(/.*)?/bin/msiexec, /opt/google/picasa(/.*)?/bin/notepad, /opt/google/picasa(/.*)?/bin/progman, /opt/google/picasa(/.*)?/bin/regedit, /opt/google/picasa(/.*)?/bin/regsvr32, /opt/google/picasa(/.*)?/Picasa3/.*exe, /opt/google/picasa(/.*)?/bin/uninstaller, /opt/cxoffice/bin/wine.*, /opt/picasa/wine/bin/wine.*, /usr/bin/msiexec, /usr/bin/notepad, /usr/bin/regedit, /usr/bin/regsvr32, /usr/bin/uninstaller, /home/[^/]*/cxoffice/bin/wine.+, /home/dwalsh/cxoffice/bin/wine.+, /var/lib/xguest/home/xguest/cxoffice/bin/wine.+
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux wine policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their wine processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for wine:

.EX
.B wine_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  wine policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run wine with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to ignore wine mmap_zero errors, you must turn on the wine_mmap_zero_ignore boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P wine_mmap_zero_ignore 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to ignore wine mmap_zero errors, you must turn on the wine_mmap_zero_ignore boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P wine_mmap_zero_ignore 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux wine policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their wine processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following file types are defined for wine:


.EX
.PP
.B wine_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the wine_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the wine_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B wine_tmp_t
.EE

- Set files with the wine_tmp_t type, if you want to store wine temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type wine_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B wine_tmp_t


.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
