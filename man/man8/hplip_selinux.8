.SH "NAME"
hplip_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the hplip processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the hplip processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux hplip policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their hplip processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for hplip:


.EX
.B hplip_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the hplip_etc_t context, if you want to store hplip files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.B hplip_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the hplip_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the hplip_t domain.


.EX
.B hplip_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the hplip_tmp_t context, if you want to store hplip temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B hplip_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the hplip_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the hplip files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.B hplip_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the hplip_var_run_t context, if you want to store the hplip files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux
