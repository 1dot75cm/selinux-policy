.SH "NAME"
sendmail_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the sendmail processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the sendmail processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  sendmail policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run sendmail with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow http daemon to send mai, you must turn on the httpd_can_sendmail boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P httpd_can_sendmail 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow syslogd daemon to send mai, you must turn on the logging_syslogd_can_sendmail boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P logging_syslogd_can_sendmail 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow gitisis daemon to send mai, you must turn on the gitosis_can_sendmail boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P gitosis_can_sendmail 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux sendmail policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their sendmail processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for sendmail:


.EX
.B sendmail_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the sendmail_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the sendmail_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/bin/mail(x)?, /usr/sbin/rmail, /usr/sbin/ssmtp, /usr/bin/esmtp, /var/qmail/bin/sendmail, /usr/sbin/sendmail\.postfix, /usr/lib/courier/bin/sendmail, /usr/lib/sendmail, /bin/mail(x)?, /usr/sbin/sendmail(\.sendmail)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B sendmail_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the sendmail_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the sendmail_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B sendmail_keytab_t 
.EE

- Set files with the sendmail_keytab_t type, if you want to treat the files as kerberos keytab files.


.EX
.B sendmail_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the sendmail_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as sendmail log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/log/sendmail\.st, /var/log/mail(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B sendmail_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the sendmail_tmp_t type, if you want to store sendmail temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B sendmail_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the sendmail_var_run_t type, if you want to store the sendmail files under the /run directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/run/sendmail\.pid, /var/run/sm-client\.pid
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
