.SH "NAME"
mpd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the mpd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the mpd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  mpd policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run mpd with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow mplayer executable stac, you must turn on the allow_mplayer_execstack boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P allow_mplayer_execstack 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow all daemons to write corefiles to , you must turn on the allow_daemons_dump_core boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P allow_daemons_dump_core 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow Apache to execute tmp content, you must turn on the httpd_tmp_exec boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P httpd_tmp_exec 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow video playing tools to run unconfine, you must turn on the unconfined_mplayer boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P unconfined_mplayer 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow gssd to read temp directory.  For access to kerberos tgt, you must turn on the allow_gssd_read_tmp boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P allow_gssd_read_tmp 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux mpd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their mpd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for mpd:


.EX
.B mpd_data_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mpd_data_t type, if you want to treat the files as mpd content.

.br
Paths: 
/var/lib/mpd/playlists(/.*)?, /var/lib/mpd/music(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B mpd_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mpd_etc_t type, if you want to store mpd files in the /etc directories.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B mpd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mpd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the mpd_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B mpd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mpd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the mpd_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B mpd_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mpd_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as mpd log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.B mpd_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mpd_tmp_t type, if you want to store mpd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B mpd_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mpd_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store mpd files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.B mpd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mpd_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the mpd files under the /var/lib directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux mpd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their mpd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for mpd:
.EX

.B mpd_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 6600
.EE
.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
