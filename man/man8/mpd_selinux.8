.SH "NAME"
mpd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the mpd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the mpd processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The mpd processes execute with the mpd_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep mpd_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The mpd_t SELinux type can be entered via the \fBmpd_exec_t\fP file type.

The default entrypoint paths for the mpd_t domain are the following:

/usr/bin/mpd
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux mpd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their mpd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for mpd:

.EX
.B mpd_t, mplayer_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a mpd_t
can be used to make the process type mpd_t permissive. SELinux does not deny access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  mpd policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run mpd with the tightest access possible.

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux mpd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their mpd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP

.PP
.B EQUIVALENCE DIRECTORIES

.PP
mpd policy stores data with multiple different file context types under the /var/lib/mpd directory.  If you would like to store the data in a different directory you can use the semanage command to create an equivalence mapping.  If you wanted to store this data under the /srv dirctory you would execute the following command:
.PP
.B semanage fcontext -a -e /var/lib/mpd /srv/mpd
.br
.B restorecon -R -v /srv/mpd
.PP

.PP
.B STANDARD FILE CONTEXT

SELinux defines the file context types for the mpd, if you wanted to
store files with these types in a diffent paths, you need to execute the semanage command to sepecify alternate labeling and then use restorecon to put the labels on disk.

.B semanage fcontext -a -t mpd_data_t '/srv/mpd/content(/.*)?'
.br
.B restorecon -R -v /srv/mympd_content

Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify labels that match multiple files.

.I The following file types are defined for mpd:


.EX
.PP
.B mpd_data_t
.EE

- Set files with the mpd_data_t type, if you want to treat the files as mpd content.

.br
.TP 5
Paths:
/var/lib/mpd/music(/.*)?, /var/lib/mpd/playlists(/.*)?

.EX
.PP
.B mpd_etc_t
.EE

- Set files with the mpd_etc_t type, if you want to store mpd files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.PP
.B mpd_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the mpd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the mpd_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B mpd_initrc_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the mpd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the mpd_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B mpd_log_t
.EE

- Set files with the mpd_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as mpd log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.PP
.B mpd_tmp_t
.EE

- Set files with the mpd_tmp_t type, if you want to store mpd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B mpd_tmpfs_t
.EE

- Set files with the mpd_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store mpd files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.PP
.B mpd_user_data_t
.EE

- Set files with the mpd_user_data_t type, if you want to treat the files as mpd user content.


.EX
.PP
.B mpd_var_lib_t
.EE

- Set files with the mpd_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the mpd files under the /var/lib directory.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage port
can also be used to manipulate the port definitions

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
