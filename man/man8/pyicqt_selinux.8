.SH "NAME"
pyicqt_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the pyicqt processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the pyicqt processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux pyicqt policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their pyicqt processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for pyicqt:


.EX
.B pyicqt_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the pyicqt_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the pyicqt_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/usr/share/pyicq-t/PyICQt\.py

.EX
.B pyicqt_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the pyicqt_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as pyicqt log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/log/pyicq-t\.log

.EX
.B pyicqt_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the pyicqt_var_run_t context, if you want to store the pyicqt files under the /run directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/run/pyicq-t(/.*)?

.EX
.B pyicqt_var_spool_t 
.EE

- Set files with the pyicqt_var_spool_t context, if you want to store the pyicqt var files under the /var/spool directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/spool/pyicq-t(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
