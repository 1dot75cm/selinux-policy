.SH "NAME"
dovecot_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the dovecot processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the dovecot processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux dovecot policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their dovecot processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for dovecot:


.EX
.B dovecot_auth_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dovecot_auth_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the dovecot_auth_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/libexec/dovecot/auth, /usr/libexec/dovecot/dovecot-auth
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B dovecot_auth_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dovecot_auth_tmp_t type, if you want to store dovecot auth temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B dovecot_cert_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dovecot_cert_t type, if you want to treat the files as dovecot certificate data.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/share/ssl/private/dovecot\.pem, /etc/pki/dovecot(/.*)?, /usr/share/ssl/certs/dovecot\.pem
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B dovecot_deliver_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dovecot_deliver_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the dovecot_deliver_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/libexec/dovecot/dovecot-lda, /usr/libexec/dovecot/deliver
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B dovecot_deliver_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dovecot_deliver_tmp_t type, if you want to store dovecot deliver temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B dovecot_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dovecot_etc_t type, if you want to store dovecot files in the /etc directories.

.br
Paths: 
/etc/dovecot(/.*)?*, /etc/dovecot\.conf.*
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B dovecot_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dovecot_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the dovecot_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B dovecot_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dovecot_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the dovecot_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B dovecot_keytab_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dovecot_keytab_t type, if you want to treat the files as kerberos keytab files.


.EX
.B dovecot_passwd_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dovecot_passwd_t type, if you want to treat the files as dovecot passwd data.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B dovecot_spool_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dovecot_spool_t type, if you want to store the dovecot files under the /var/spool directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B dovecot_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dovecot_tmp_t type, if you want to store dovecot temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B dovecot_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dovecot_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the dovecot files under the /var/lib directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/run/dovecot/login/ssl-parameters.dat, /var/lib/dovecot(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B dovecot_var_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dovecot_var_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as dovecot var log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/log/dovecot\.log.*, /var/log/dovecot(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B dovecot_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dovecot_var_run_t type, if you want to store the dovecot files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.
