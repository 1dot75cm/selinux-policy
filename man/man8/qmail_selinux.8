.SH "NAME"
qmail_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the qmail processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the qmail processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux qmail policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their qmail processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for qmail:


.EX
.B qmail_alias_home_t 
.EE

- Set files with the qmail_alias_home_t type, if you want to store qmail alias files in the users home directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/qmail/alias, /var/qmail/alias(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B qmail_clean_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the qmail_clean_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the qmail_clean_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use

to apply the labels.


.EX
.B qmail_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the qmail_etc_t type, if you want to store qmail files in the /etc directories.

.br
Paths: 
/var/qmail/owners(/.*)?, /var/qmail/control(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the

to apply the labels.


.EX

to apply the labels.


.EX
.B qmail_keytab_t 
.EE

- Set files with the qmail_keytab_t type, if you want to treat the files as kerberos keytab files.
