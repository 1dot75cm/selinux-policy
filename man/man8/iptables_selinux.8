.SH "NAME"
iptables_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the iptables processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the iptables processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux iptables policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their iptables processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for iptables:


.EX
.B iptables_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the iptables_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the iptables_t domain.


.EX
.B iptables_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the iptables_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the iptables_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B iptables_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the iptables_tmp_t context, if you want to store iptables temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B iptables_unit_file_t 
.EE

- Set files with the iptables_unit_file_t context, if you want to treat the files as iptables unit content.


.EX
.B iptables_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the iptables_var_run_t context, if you want to store the iptables files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  iptables policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run iptables with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow dhcpc client applications to execute iptables commands, you must turn on the dhcpc_exec_iptables boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P dhcpc_exec_iptables 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
