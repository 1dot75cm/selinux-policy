.SH "NAME"
udev_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the udev processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the udev processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux udev policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their udev processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for udev:


.EX
.B udev_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the udev_etc_t context, if you want to store udev files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.B udev_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the udev_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the udev_t domain.


.EX
.B udev_helper_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the udev_helper_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the udev_helper_t domain.


.EX
.B udev_rules_t 
.EE

- Set files with the udev_rules_t context, if you want to treat the files as udev rules data.


.EX
.B udev_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the udev_var_run_t context, if you want to store the udev files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
