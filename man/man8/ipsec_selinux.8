.SH "NAME"
ipsec_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the ipsec processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the ipsec processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.PP
If you want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd serve for the ipsec_t, ipsec_mgmt_t, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean.

.EX
setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos for the ipsec_t, ipsec_mgmt_t, you must turn on the kerberos_enabled boolean.

.EX
setsebool -P kerberos_enabled 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux ipsec policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ipsec processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for ipsec:


.EX
.PP
.B ipsec_conf_file_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ipsec_conf_file_t type, if you want to treat the files as ipsec conf content.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/etc/ipsec\.conf, /etc/racoon(/.*)?

.EX
.PP
.B ipsec_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ipsec_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the ipsec_t domain.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/usr/local/lib/ipsec/eroute, /usr/lib/ipsec/pluto, /usr/local/lib/ipsec/pluto, /usr/lib/ipsec/klipsdebug, /usr/libexec/ipsec/eroute, /usr/libexec/ipsec/pluto, /usr/lib/ipsec/spi, /usr/lib/ipsec/eroute, /usr/local/lib/ipsec/klipsdebug, /usr/local/lib/ipsec/spi, /usr/libexec/ipsec/spi, /usr/libexec/ipsec/klipsdebug

.EX
.PP
.B ipsec_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ipsec_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the ipsec_initrc_t domain.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/racoon, /etc/rc\.d/init\.d/ipsec

.EX
.PP
.B ipsec_key_file_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ipsec_key_file_t type, if you want to treat the files as ipsec key content.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/etc/ipsec\.secrets, /etc/racoon/certs(/.*)?, /etc/racoon/psk\.txt, /etc/ipsec\.d(/.*)?

.EX
.PP
.B ipsec_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ipsec_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as ipsec log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.PP
.B ipsec_mgmt_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ipsec_mgmt_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the ipsec_mgmt_t domain.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/usr/lib/ipsec/_plutorun, /usr/libexec/ipsec/_plutoload, /usr/libexec/nm-openswan-service, /usr/sbin/ipsec, /usr/lib/ipsec/_plutoload, /usr/libexec/ipsec/_plutorun

.EX
.PP
.B ipsec_mgmt_lock_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ipsec_mgmt_lock_t type, if you want to treat the files as ipsec mgmt lock data, stored under the /var/lock directory


.EX
.PP
.B ipsec_mgmt_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ipsec_mgmt_var_run_t type, if you want to store the ipsec mgmt files under the /run directory.


.EX
.PP
.B ipsec_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ipsec_tmp_t type, if you want to store ipsec temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B ipsec_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ipsec_var_run_t type, if you want to store the ipsec files under the /run directory.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/var/run/racoon\.pid, /var/run/pluto(/.*)?, /var/racoon(/.*)?

.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux ipsec policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ipsec processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for ipsec:

.EX
.TP 5
.B ipsecnat_port_t 
.TP 10
.EE


Default Defined Ports:
tcp 4500
.EE
udp 4500
.EE
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. 
SELinux ipsec policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ipsec processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following process types are defined for ipsec:

.EX
.B ipsec_t, ipsec_mgmt_t 
.EE
.PP
Note: 
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE 
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage port
can also be used to manipulate the port definitions

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
