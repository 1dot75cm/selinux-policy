.SH "NAME"
ipsec_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the ipsec processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the ipsec processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux ipsec policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ipsec processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for ipsec:


.EX
.B ipsec_conf_file_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ipsec_conf_file_t context, if you want to treat the files as ipsec conf content.


.EX
.B ipsec_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ipsec_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the ipsec_t domain.


.EX
.B ipsec_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ipsec_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the ipsec_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B ipsec_key_file_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ipsec_key_file_t context, if you want to treat the files as ipsec key content.


.EX
.B ipsec_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ipsec_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as ipsec log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.B ipsec_mgmt_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ipsec_mgmt_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the ipsec_mgmt_t domain.


.EX
.B ipsec_mgmt_lock_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ipsec_mgmt_lock_t context, if you want to treat the files as ipsec mgmt lock data, stored under the /var/lock directory


.EX
.B ipsec_mgmt_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ipsec_mgmt_var_run_t context, if you want to store the ipsec mgmt files under the /run directory.


.EX
.B ipsec_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ipsec_tmp_t context, if you want to store ipsec temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B ipsec_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ipsec_var_run_t context, if you want to store the ipsec files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
