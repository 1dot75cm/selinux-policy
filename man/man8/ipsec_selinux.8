.SH "NAME"
ipsec_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the ipsec processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the ipsec processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The ipsec processes execute with the ipsec_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep ipsec_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The ipsec_t SELinux type can be entered via the \fBipsec_exec_t\fP file type.

The default entrypoint paths for the ipsec_t domain are the following:

/usr/lib/ipsec/spi, /usr/lib/ipsec/pluto, /usr/lib/ipsec/eroute, /usr/libexec/ipsec/spi, /usr/libexec/ipsec/pluto, /usr/lib/ipsec/klipsdebug, /usr/libexec/ipsec/eroute, /usr/libexec/ipsec/klipsdebug
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux ipsec policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ipsec processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for ipsec:

.EX
.B ipsec_t, ipsec_mgmt_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a ipsec_t
can be used to make the process type ipsec_t permissive. SELinux does not deny access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  ipsec policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run ipsec with the tightest access possible.

.EE
udp 4500
.EE
.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type ipsec_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux ipsec policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ipsec processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP

.PP
.B STANDARD FILE CONTEXT

SELinux defines the file context types for the ipsec, if you wanted to
store files with these types in a diffent paths, you need to execute the semanage command to sepecify alternate labeling and then use restorecon to put the labels on disk.

.B semanage fcontext -a -t ipsec_conf_file_t '/srv/ipsec/content(/.*)?'
.br
.B restorecon -R -v /srv/myipsec_content

Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify labels that match multiple files.

.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage port
can also be used to manipulate the port definitions

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans
