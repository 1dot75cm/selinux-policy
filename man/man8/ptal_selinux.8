.SH "NAME"
ptal_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the ptal processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the ptal processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux ptal policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ptal processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for ptal:


.EX
.B ptal_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ptal_etc_t type, if you want to store ptal files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.B ptal_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ptal_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the ptal_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/ptal-photod, /usr/sbin/ptal-mlcd, /usr/sbin/ptal-printd
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B ptal_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ptal_var_run_t type, if you want to store the ptal files under the /run directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/run/ptal-mlcd(/.*)?, /var/run/ptal-printd(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux ptal policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ptal processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for ptal:
.EX

.B ptal_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 5703
.EE
.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
