.SH "NAME"
ntop_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the ntop processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the ntop processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux ntop policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ntop processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for ntop:


.EX
.B ntop_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntop_etc_t context, if you want to store ntop files in the /etc directories.

.br
Path: 
/etc/ntop(/.*)?

.EX
.B ntop_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntop_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the ntop_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/usr/bin/ntop

.EX
.B ntop_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntop_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the ntop_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B ntop_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntop_tmp_t context, if you want to store ntop temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B ntop_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntop_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the ntop files under the /var/lib directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/lib/ntop(/.*)?

.EX
.B ntop_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntop_var_run_t context, if you want to store the ntop files under the /run directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/run/ntop\.pid
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
