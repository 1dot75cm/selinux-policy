.SH "NAME"
ntop_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the ntop processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the ntop processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux ntop policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ntop processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for ntop:


.EX
.B ntop_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntop_etc_t type, if you want to store ntop files in the /etc directories.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B ntop_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntop_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the ntop_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B ntop_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntop_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the ntop_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B ntop_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntop_tmp_t type, if you want to store ntop temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B ntop_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntop_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the ntop files under the /var/lib directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B ntop_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ntop_var_run_t type, if you want to store the ntop files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux ntop policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ntop processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for ntop:
.EX

.B ntop_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 3000-3001
.EE
.B udp 3000-3001
.EE
.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
