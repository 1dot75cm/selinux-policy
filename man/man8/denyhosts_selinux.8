.SH "NAME"
denyhosts_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the denyhosts processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the denyhosts processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux denyhosts policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their denyhosts processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for denyhosts:


.EX
.B denyhosts_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the denyhosts_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the denyhosts_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/usr/bin/denyhosts\.py

.EX
.B denyhosts_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the denyhosts_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the denyhosts_initrc_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/denyhosts

.EX
.B denyhosts_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the denyhosts_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the denyhosts files under the /var/lib directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/lib/denyhosts(/.*)?

.EX
.B denyhosts_var_lock_t 
.EE

- Set files with the denyhosts_var_lock_t context, if you want to treat the files as denyhosts var lock data, stored under the /var/lock directory

.br
Path: 
/var/lock/subsys/denyhosts

.EX
.B denyhosts_var_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the denyhosts_var_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as denyhosts var log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/log/denyhosts(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
