.SH "NAME"
nginx_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the nginx processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the nginx processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux nginx policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their nginx processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for nginx:


.EX
.B nginx_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the nginx_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the nginx_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/usr/sbin/nginx

.EX
.B nginx_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the nginx_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the nginx_initrc_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/nginx

.EX
.B nginx_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the nginx_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as nginx log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/log/nginx(/.*)?

.EX
.B nginx_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the nginx_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the nginx files under the /var/lib directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/lib/nginx(/.*)?

.EX
.B nginx_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the nginx_var_run_t context, if you want to store the nginx files under the /run directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/run/nginx.*
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
