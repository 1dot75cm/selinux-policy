.SH "NAME"
semanage_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the semanage processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the semanage processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The semanage processes execute with the semanage_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep semanage_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The semanage_t SELinux type can be entered via the \fBsemanage_exec_t\fP file type.

The default entrypoint paths for the semanage_t domain are the following:

/usr/sbin/semanage, /usr/sbin/semodule, /usr/share/system-config-selinux/system-config-selinux-dbus\.py
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux semanage policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their semanage processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for semanage:

.EX
.B semanage_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a semanage_t
can be used to make the process type semanage_t permissive. SELinux does not deny access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  semanage policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run semanage with the tightest access possible.

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux semanage policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their semanage processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP

.PP
.B STANDARD FILE CONTEXT

SELinux defines the file context types for the semanage, if you wanted to
store files with these types in a diffent paths, you need to execute the semanage command to sepecify alternate labeling and then use restorecon to put the labels on disk.

.B semanage fcontext -a -t semanage_exec_t '/srv/semanage/content(/.*)?'
.br
.B restorecon -R -v /srv/mysemanage_content

Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify labels that match multiple files.

.I The following file types are defined for semanage:


.EX
.PP
.B semanage_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the semanage_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the semanage_t domain.

.br
.TP 5
Paths:
/usr/sbin/semanage, /usr/sbin/semodule, /usr/share/system-config-selinux/system-config-selinux-dbus\.py

.EX
.PP
.B semanage_read_lock_t
.EE

- Set files with the semanage_read_lock_t type, if you want to treat the files as semanage read lock data, stored under the /var/lock directory


.EX
.PP
.B semanage_store_t
.EE

- Set files with the semanage_store_t type, if you want to treat the files as semanage store data.

.br
.TP 5
Paths:
/etc/selinux/([^/]*/)?policy(/.*)?, /etc/selinux/([^/]*/)?modules/(active|tmp|previous)(/.*)?, /etc/share/selinux/mls(/.*)?, /etc/share/selinux/targeted(/.*)?

.EX
.PP
.B semanage_tmp_t
.EE

- Set files with the semanage_tmp_t type, if you want to store semanage temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B semanage_trans_lock_t
.EE

- Set files with the semanage_trans_lock_t type, if you want to treat the files as semanage trans lock data, stored under the /var/lock directory


.EX
.PP
.B semanage_var_lib_t
.EE

- Set files with the semanage_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the semanage files under the /var/lib directory.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
