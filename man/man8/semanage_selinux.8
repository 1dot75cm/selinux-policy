.SH "NAME"
semanage_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the semanage processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the semanage processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux semanage policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their semanage processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for semanage:


.EX
.B semanage_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the semanage_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the semanage_t domain.


.EX
.B semanage_read_lock_t 
.EE

- Set files with the semanage_read_lock_t context, if you want to treat the files as semanage read lock data.


.EX
.B semanage_store_t 
.EE

- Set files with the semanage_store_t context, if you want to treat the files as semanage store data.


.EX
.B semanage_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the semanage_tmp_t context, if you want to store semanage temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B semanage_trans_lock_t 
.EE

- Set files with the semanage_trans_lock_t context, if you want to treat the files as semanage trans lock data.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux
