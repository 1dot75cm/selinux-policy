.SH "NAME"
rpm_script_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the rpm_script processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the rpm_script processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The rpm_script processes execute with the rpm_script_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep rpm_script_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The rpm_script_t SELinux type can be entered via the \fBldconfig_exec_t, bin_t, sysctl_type, shell_exec_t, filesystem_type, mtrr_device_t, unlabeled_t, proc_type, file_type\fP file types.

The default entrypoint paths for the rpm_script_t domain are the following:

All executeables with the default executable label, usually stored in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin.
/sbin/ldconfig, /usr/sbin/ldconfig, /bin/d?ash, /bin/zsh.*, /bin/ksh.*, /usr/bin/d?ash, /usr/bin/ksh.*, /usr/bin/zsh.*, /bin/esh, /bin/mksh, /bin/sash, /bin/tcsh, /bin/yash, /bin/bash, /bin/fish, /bin/bash2, /usr/bin/esh, /usr/bin/fish, /usr/bin/bash, /usr/bin/mksh, /usr/bin/sash, /usr/bin/tcsh, /usr/bin/yash, /sbin/nologin, /usr/sbin/sesh, /usr/bin/bash2, /usr/sbin/smrsh, /usr/bin/scponly, /usr/sbin/nologin, /usr/libexec/sesh, /usr/sbin/scponlyc, /usr/bin/git-shell, /usr/libexec/git-core/git-shell, /dev/cpu/mtrr, all files on the system
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux rpm_script policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their rpm_script processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for rpm_script:

.EX
.B rpm_script_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a rpm_script_t
can be used to make the process type rpm_script_t permissive. SELinux does not deny access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  rpm_script policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run rpm_script with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd server, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean. Disabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1

.EE

.PP
If you want to deny user domains applications to map a memory region as both executable and writable, this is dangerous and the executable should be reported in bugzilla, you must turn on the deny_execmem boolean. Enabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P deny_execmem 1

.EE

.PP
If you want to allow sysadm to debug or ptrace all processes, you must turn on the deny_ptrace boolean. Enabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P deny_ptrace 1

.EE

.PP
If you want to allow all domains to use other domains file descriptors, you must turn on the domain_fd_use boolean. Enabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P domain_fd_use 1

.EE

.PP
If you want to allow all domains to have the kernel load modules, you must turn on the domain_kernel_load_modules boolean. Disabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P domain_kernel_load_modules 1

.EE

.PP
If you want to allow all domains to execute in fips_mode, you must turn on the fips_mode boolean. Enabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P fips_mode 1

.EE

.PP
If you want to enable reading of urandom for all domains, you must turn on the global_ssp boolean. Disabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P global_ssp 1

.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos, you must turn on the kerberos_enabled boolean. Enabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P kerberos_enabled 1

.EE

.PP
If you want to control the ability to mmap a low area of the address space, as configured by /proc/sys/kernel/mmap_min_addr, you must turn on the mmap_low_allowed boolean. Disabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P mmap_low_allowed 1

.EE

.PP
If you want to allow system to run with NIS, you must turn on the nis_enabled boolean. Disabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P nis_enabled 1

.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to use nscd shared memory, you must turn on the nscd_use_shm boolean. Disabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P nscd_use_shm 1

.EE

.PP
If you want to disable kernel module loading, you must turn on the secure_mode_insmod boolean. Enabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P secure_mode_insmod 1

.EE

.PP
If you want to boolean to determine whether the system permits loading policy, setting enforcing mode, and changing boolean values.  Set this to true and you have to reboot to set it back, you must turn on the secure_mode_policyload boolean. Enabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P secure_mode_policyload 1

.EE

.PP
If you want to allow unconfined executables to make their heap memory executable.  Doing this is a really bad idea. Probably indicates a badly coded executable, but could indicate an attack. This executable should be reported in bugzilla, you must turn on the selinuxuser_execheap boolean. Disabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P selinuxuser_execheap 1

.EE

.PP
If you want to allow all unconfined executables to use libraries requiring text relocation that are not labeled textrel_shlib_t, you must turn on the selinuxuser_execmod boolean. Enabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P selinuxuser_execmod 1

.EE

.PP
If you want to allow unconfined executables to make their stack executable.  This should never, ever be necessary. Probably indicates a badly coded executable, but could indicate an attack. This executable should be reported in bugzilla, you must turn on the selinuxuser_execstack boolean. Enabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P selinuxuser_execstack 1

.EE

.PP

.B setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos for the rpm_script_t, you must turn on the kerberos_enabled boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P kerberos_enabled 1
.EE

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type rpm_script_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B file_type

	all files on the system
.br

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
