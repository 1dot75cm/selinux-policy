.SH "NAME"
wdmd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the wdmd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the wdmd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux wdmd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their wdmd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for wdmd:


.EX
.B wdmd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the wdmd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the wdmd_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B wdmd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the wdmd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the wdmd_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B wdmd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the wdmd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the wdmd files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.
