.SH "NAME"
kdumpgui_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the kdumpgui processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the kdumpgui processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux kdumpgui policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their kdumpgui processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for kdumpgui:


.EX
.B kdumpgui_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the kdumpgui_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the kdumpgui_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/usr/share/system-config-kdump/system-config-kdump-backend\.py

.EX
.B kdumpgui_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the kdumpgui_tmp_t context, if you want to store kdumpgui temporary files in the /tmp directories.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
