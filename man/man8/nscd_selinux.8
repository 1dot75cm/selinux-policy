.SH "NAME"
nscd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the nscd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the nscd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux nscd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their nscd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for nscd:


.EX
.B nscd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the nscd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the nscd_t domain.


.EX
.B nscd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the nscd_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the nscd_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B nscd_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the nscd_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as nscd log data, usually stored in /var/log.


.EX
.B nscd_unit_file_t 
.EE

- Set files with the nscd_unit_file_t context, if you want to treat the files as nscd unit content.


.EX
.B nscd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the nscd_var_run_t context, if you want to store the nscd files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  nscd policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run nscd with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to use nscd shared memory., you must turn on the nscd_use_shm boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P nscd_use_shm 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
