.SH "NAME"
nscd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the nscd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the nscd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  nscd policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run nscd with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to use nscd shared memory, you must turn on the nscd_use_shm boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P nscd_use_shm 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux nscd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their nscd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for nscd:


.EX
.B nscd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the nscd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the nscd_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B nscd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the nscd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the nscd_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B nscd_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the nscd_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as nscd log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B nscd_unit_file_t 
.EE

- Set files with the nscd_unit_file_t type, if you want to treat the files as nscd unit content.


.EX
.B nscd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the nscd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the nscd files under the /run directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/run/nscd\.pid, /var/run/nscd(/.*)?, /var/db/nscd(/.*)?, /var/run/\.nscd_socket, /var/cache/nscd(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
