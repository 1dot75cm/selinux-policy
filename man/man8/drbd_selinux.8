.SH "NAME"
drbd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the drbd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the drbd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux drbd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their drbd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for drbd:


.EX
.B drbd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the drbd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the drbd_t domain.


.EX
.B drbd_lock_t 
.EE

- Set files with the drbd_lock_t context, if you want to treat the files as drbd lock data, stored under the /var/lock directory


.EX
.B drbd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the drbd_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the drbd files under the /var/lib directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
