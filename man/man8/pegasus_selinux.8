.SH "NAME"
pegasus_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the pegasus processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the pegasus processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux pegasus policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their pegasus processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for pegasus:


.EX
.B pegasus_conf_t 
.EE

- Set files with the pegasus_conf_t type, if you want to treat the files as pegasus configuration data, usually stored under the /etc directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B pegasus_data_t 
.EE

- Set files with the pegasus_data_t type, if you want to treat the files as pegasus content.

.br
Paths: 
/etc/Pegasus/pegasus_current\.conf, /var/lib/Pegasus(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B pegasus_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the pegasus_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the pegasus_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/init_repository, /usr/sbin/cimserver
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B pegasus_mof_t 
.EE

- Set files with the pegasus_mof_t type, if you want to treat the files as pegasus mof data.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B pegasus_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the pegasus_tmp_t type, if you want to store pegasus temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B pegasus_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the pegasus_var_run_t type, if you want to store the pegasus files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux pegasus policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their pegasus processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for pegasus:
.EX

.B pegasus_http_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 5988
.EE
.EX

.B pegasus_https_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 5989
.EE
.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
