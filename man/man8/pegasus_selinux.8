.SH "NAME"
pegasus_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the pegasus processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the pegasus processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux pegasus policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their pegasus processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for pegasus:


.EX
.B pegasus_conf_t 
.EE

- Set files with the pegasus_conf_t context, if you want to treat the files as pegasus configuration data, usually stored under the /etc directory.

.br
Path: 
/etc/Pegasus(/.*)?

.EX
.B pegasus_data_t 
.EE

- Set files with the pegasus_data_t context, if you want to treat the files as pegasus content.

.br
Paths: 
/etc/Pegasus/pegasus_current\.conf, /var/lib/Pegasus(/.*)?

.EX
.B pegasus_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the pegasus_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the pegasus_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/init_repository, /usr/sbin/cimserver

.EX
.B pegasus_mof_t 
.EE

- Set files with the pegasus_mof_t context, if you want to treat the files as pegasus mof data.

.br
Path: 
/usr/share/Pegasus/mof(/.*)?/.*\.mof

.EX
.B pegasus_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the pegasus_tmp_t context, if you want to store pegasus temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B pegasus_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the pegasus_var_run_t context, if you want to store the pegasus files under the /run directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/run/tog-pegasus(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
