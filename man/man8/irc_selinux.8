.SH "NAME"
irc_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the irc processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the irc processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux irc policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their irc processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for irc:


.EX
.B irc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the irc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the irc_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/bin/ircII, /usr/bin/tinyirc, /usr/bin/[st]irc

.EX
.B irc_home_t 
.EE

- Set files with the irc_home_t context, if you want to store irc files in the users home directory.


.EX
.B irc_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the irc_tmp_t context, if you want to store irc temporary files in the /tmp directories.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
