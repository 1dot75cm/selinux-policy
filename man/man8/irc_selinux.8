.SH "NAME"
irc_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the irc processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the irc processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The irc processes execute with the irc_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep irc_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The irc_t SELinux type can be entered via the \fBirc_exec_t\fP file type.

The default entrypoint paths for the irc_t domain are the following:

/usr/bin/[st]irc, /usr/bin/ircII, /usr/bin/irssi, /usr/bin/tinyirc
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux irc policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their irc processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for irc:

.EX
.B irc_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a irc_t
can be used to make the process type irc_t permissive. SELinux does not deny access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  irc policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run irc with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to determine whether irc clients can listen on and connect to any unreserved TCP ports, you must turn on the irc_use_any_tcp_ports boolean. Disabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P irc_use_any_tcp_ports 1

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports.
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command:

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports.
SELinux irc policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their irc processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following port types are defined for irc:

.EX
.TP 5
.B ircd_port_t
.TP 10
.EE


Default Defined Ports:
tcp 6667,6697
.EE
.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type irc_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux irc policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their irc processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP

.PP
.B STANDARD FILE CONTEXT

SELinux defines the file context types for the irc, if you wanted to
store files with these types in a diffent paths, you need to execute the semanage command to sepecify alternate labeling and then use restorecon to put the labels on disk.

.B semanage fcontext -a -t irc_conf_t '/srv/irc/content(/.*)?'
.br
.B restorecon -R -v /srv/myirc_content

Note: SELinux often uses regular expressions to specify labels that match multiple files.

.I The following file types are defined for irc:


.EX
.PP
.B irc_conf_t
.EE

- Set files with the irc_conf_t type, if you want to treat the files as irc configuration data, usually stored under the /etc directory.


.EX
.PP
.B irc_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the irc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the irc_t domain.

.br
.TP 5
Paths:
/usr/bin/[st]irc, /usr/bin/ircII, /usr/bin/irssi, /usr/bin/tinyirc

.EX
.PP
.B irc_home_t
.EE

- Set files with the irc_home_t type, if you want to store irc files in the users home directory.

.br
.TP 5
Paths:
/home/[^/]*/\.irssi(/.*)?, /home/[^/]*/\.ircmotd, /home/pwalsh/\.irssi(/.*)?, /home/pwalsh/\.ircmotd, /home/dwalsh/\.irssi(/.*)?, /home/dwalsh/\.ircmotd, /var/lib/xguest/home/xguest/\.irssi(/.*)?, /var/lib/xguest/home/xguest/\.ircmotd

.EX
.PP
.B irc_log_home_t
.EE

- Set files with the irc_log_home_t type, if you want to store irc log files in the users home directory.

.br
.TP 5
Paths:
/home/[^/]*/irclogs(/.*)?, /home/pwalsh/irclogs(/.*)?, /home/dwalsh/irclogs(/.*)?, /var/lib/xguest/home/xguest/irclogs(/.*)?

.EX
.PP
.B irc_tmp_t
.EE

- Set files with the irc_tmp_t type, if you want to store irc temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage port
can also be used to manipulate the port definitions

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
