.SH "NAME"
mongod_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the mongod processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the mongod processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux mongod policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their mongod processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for mongod:


.EX
.B mongod_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mongod_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the mongod_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/bin/mongod, /usr/share/aeolus-conductor/dbomatic/dbomatic
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B mongod_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mongod_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the mongod_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B mongod_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mongod_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as mongod log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B mongod_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mongod_tmp_t type, if you want to store mongod temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B mongod_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mongod_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the mongod files under the /var/lib directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B mongod_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mongod_var_run_t type, if you want to store the mongod files under the /run directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/run/mongodb(/.*)?, /var/run/aeolus/dbomatic\.pid
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux mongod policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their mongod processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for mongod:
.EX

.B mongod_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 27017
.EE
.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
