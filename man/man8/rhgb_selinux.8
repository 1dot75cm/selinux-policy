.SH "NAME"
rhgb_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the rhgb processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the rhgb processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux rhgb policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their rhgb processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for rhgb:


.EX
.B rhgb_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rhgb_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the rhgb_t domain.


.EX
.B rhgb_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the rhgb_tmpfs_t context, if you want to store rhgb files on a tmpfs file system.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
