.SH "NAME"
dnssec_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the dnssec processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the dnssec processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux dnssec policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their dnssec processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for dnssec:


.EX
.B dnssec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dnssec_t context, if you want to treat the files as dnssec data.

.br
Paths: 
/etc/unbound/.*\.key, /var/named/chroot/etc/rndc\.key, /etc/dnssec-trigger/dnssec_trigger_server\.key, /etc/rndc\.key

.EX
.B dnssec_trigger_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dnssec_trigger_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the dnssec_trigger_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/usr/sbin/dnssec-triggerd

.EX
.B dnssec_trigger_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dnssec_trigger_var_run_t context, if you want to store the dnssec trigger files under the /run directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/run/dnssec.*
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
