.SH "NAME"
inetd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the inetd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the inetd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux inetd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their inetd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for inetd:


.EX
.B inetd_child_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the inetd_child_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the inetd_child_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/identd, /usr/local/lib/pysieved/pysieved.*\.py, /usr/sbin/in\..*d

.EX
.B inetd_child_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the inetd_child_tmp_t context, if you want to store inetd child temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B inetd_child_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the inetd_child_var_run_t context, if you want to store the inetd child files under the /run directory.


.EX
.B inetd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the inetd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the inetd_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/inetd, /usr/sbin/xinetd, /usr/sbin/rlinetd

.EX
.B inetd_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the inetd_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as inetd log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/log/(x)?inetd\.log

.EX
.B inetd_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the inetd_tmp_t context, if you want to store inetd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B inetd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the inetd_var_run_t context, if you want to store the inetd files under the /run directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/run/(x)?inetd\.pid
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
