.SH "NAME"
kpropd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the kpropd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the kpropd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux kpropd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their kpropd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for kpropd:


.EX
.B kpropd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the kpropd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the kpropd_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux kpropd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their kpropd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for kpropd:
.EX

.B kprop_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 754
