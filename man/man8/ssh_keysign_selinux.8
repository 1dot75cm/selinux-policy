.SH "NAME"
ssh_keysign_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the ssh_keysign processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the ssh_keysign processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The ssh_keysign processes execute with the ssh_keysign_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier. 

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep ssh_keysign_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The ssh_keysign_t SELinux type can be entered via the "ssh_keysign_exec_t" file type.  The default entrypoint paths for the ssh_keysign_t domain are the following:"

/usr/libexec/openssh/ssh-keysign
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. 
SELinux ssh_keysign policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ssh_keysign processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following process types are defined for ssh_keysign:

.EX
.B ssh_keysign_t 
.EE
.PP
Note: 
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE 
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  ssh_keysign policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run ssh_keysign with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow host key based authentication, you must turn on the ssh_keysign boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P ssh_keysign 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow host key based authentication, you must turn on the ssh_keysign boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P ssh_keysign 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux ssh_keysign policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ssh_keysign processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for ssh_keysign:


.EX
.PP
.B ssh_keysign_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ssh_keysign_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the ssh_keysign_t domain.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
