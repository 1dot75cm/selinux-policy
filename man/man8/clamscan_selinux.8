.SH "NAME"
clamscan_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the clamscan processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the clamscan processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The clamscan processes execute with the clamscan_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep clamscan_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The clamscan_t SELinux type can be entered via the "clamscan_exec_t" file type.  The default entrypoint paths for the clamscan_t domain are the following:"

/usr/bin/clamscan, /usr/bin/clamdscan
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux clamscan policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their clamscan processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for clamscan:

.EX
.B clamscan_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  clamscan policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run clamscan with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow clamscan to non security files on a system, you must turn on the clamscan_can_scan_system boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P clamscan_can_scan_system 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow clamscan to read user content, you must turn on the clamscan_read_user_content boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P clamscan_read_user_content 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow clamscan to non security files on a system, you must turn on the clamscan_can_scan_system boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P clamscan_can_scan_system 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow clamscan to read user content, you must turn on the clamscan_read_user_content boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P clamscan_read_user_content 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files.
SELinux clamscan policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their clamscan processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following file types are defined for clamscan:


.EX
.PP
.B clamscan_exec_t
.EE

- Set files with the clamscan_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the clamscan_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B clamscan_tmp_t
.EE

- Set files with the clamscan_tmp_t type, if you want to store clamscan temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the
.B semanage fcontext
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type clamscan_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B amavis_spool_t

	/var/spool/amavisd(/.*)?
.br

.br
.B antivirus_db_t

	/var/opt/f-secure(/.*)?
.br

.br
.B clamd_var_lib_t

	/var/clamav(/.*)?
.br
	/var/lib/clamd.*
.br
	/var/lib/clamav(/.*)?
.br

.br
.B clamscan_tmp_t


.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
