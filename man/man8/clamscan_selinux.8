.SH "NAME"
clamscan_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the clamscan processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the clamscan processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux clamscan policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their clamscan processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for clamscan:


.EX
.B clamscan_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the clamscan_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the clamscan_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/bin/clamdscan, /usr/bin/clamscan

.EX
.B clamscan_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the clamscan_tmp_t context, if you want to store clamscan temporary files in the /tmp directories.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  clamscan policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run clamscan with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow clamscan to read user conten, you must turn on the clamscan_read_user_content boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P clamscan_read_user_content 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
