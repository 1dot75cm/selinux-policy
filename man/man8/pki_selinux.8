.SH "NAME"
pki_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the pki processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the pki processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux pki policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their pki processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for pki:


.EX
.B pki_ca_etc_rw_t 
.EE

- Set files with the pki_ca_etc_rw_t type, if you want to treat the files as pki ca etc read/write content.

.br
Paths: 
/etc/pki-ca(/.*)?, /etc/sysconfig/pki/ca(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the

to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux pki policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their pki processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for pki:
