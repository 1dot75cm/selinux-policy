.SH "NAME"
ctdbd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the ctdbd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the ctdbd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux ctdbd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ctdbd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for ctdbd:


.EX
.B ctdbd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ctdbd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the ctdbd_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B ctdbd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ctdbd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the ctdbd_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B ctdbd_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ctdbd_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as ctdbd log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B ctdbd_spool_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ctdbd_spool_t type, if you want to store the ctdbd files under the /var/spool directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B ctdbd_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ctdbd_tmp_t type, if you want to store ctdbd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B ctdbd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ctdbd_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the ctdbd files under the /var/lib directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/ctdb(/.*)?, /var/lib/ctdbd(/.*)?, /etc/ctdb(/.*)?, /var/ctdbd(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B ctdbd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ctdbd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the ctdbd files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux ctdbd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ctdbd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for ctdbd:
.EX

.B ctdb_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 4379
.EE
.B udp 4379
.EE
.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
