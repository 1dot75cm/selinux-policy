.SH "NAME"
ctdbd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the ctdbd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the ctdbd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux ctdbd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ctdbd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for ctdbd:


.EX
.B ctdbd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ctdbd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the ctdbd_t domain.


.EX
.B ctdbd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ctdbd_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the ctdbd_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B ctdbd_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ctdbd_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as ctdbd log data, usually stored in /var/log.


.EX
.B ctdbd_spool_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ctdbd_spool_t context, if you want to store the ctdbd files in the /var/spool directories.


.EX
.B ctdbd_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ctdbd_tmp_t context, if you want to store ctdbd temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B ctdbd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ctdbd_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the ctdbd files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.B ctdbd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ctdbd_var_run_t context, if you want to store the ctdbd files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
