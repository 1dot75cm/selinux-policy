.SH "NAME"
plymouth_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the plymouth processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the plymouth processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux plymouth policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their plymouth processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for plymouth:


.EX
.B plymouth_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the plymouth_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the plymouth_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/bin/plymouth, /bin/plymouth
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B plymouthd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the plymouthd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the plymouthd_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/plymouthd, /sbin/plymouthd
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B plymouthd_spool_t 
.EE

- Set files with the plymouthd_spool_t type, if you want to store the plymouthd files under the /var/spool directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B plymouthd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the plymouthd_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the plymouthd files under the /var/lib directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B plymouthd_var_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the plymouthd_var_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as plymouthd var log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.B plymouthd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the plymouthd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the plymouthd files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
