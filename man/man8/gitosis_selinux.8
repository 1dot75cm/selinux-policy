.SH "NAME"
gitosis_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the gitosis processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the gitosis processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux gitosis policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their gitosis processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for gitosis:


.EX
.B gitosis_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the gitosis_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the gitosis_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/bin/gitosis-serve, /usr/bin/gl-auth-command

.EX
.B gitosis_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the gitosis_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the gitosis files under the /var/lib directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/lib/gitolite(/.*)?, /var/lib/gitosis(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  gitosis policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run gitosis with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow gitisis daemon to send mai, you must turn on the gitosis_can_sendmail boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P gitosis_can_sendmail 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
