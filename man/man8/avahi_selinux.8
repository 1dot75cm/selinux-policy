.SH "NAME"
avahi_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the avahi processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the avahi processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux avahi policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their avahi processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for avahi:


.EX
.B avahi_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the avahi_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the avahi_t domain.


.EX
.B avahi_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the avahi_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the avahi_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B avahi_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the avahi_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the avahi files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.B avahi_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the avahi_var_run_t context, if you want to store the avahi files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  avahi policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run avahi with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow Apache to communicate with avahi service via dbu, you must turn on the httpd_dbus_avahi boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P httpd_dbus_avahi 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
