.SH "NAME"
amavis_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the amavis processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the amavis processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux amavis policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their amavis processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for amavis:


.EX
.B amavis_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amavis_etc_t context, if you want to store amavis files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.B amavis_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amavis_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the amavis_t domain.


.EX
.B amavis_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amavis_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the amavis_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B amavis_quarantine_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amavis_quarantine_t context, if you want to treat the files as amavis quarantine data.


.EX
.B amavis_spool_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amavis_spool_t context, if you want to store the amavis files under the /var/spool directory.


.EX
.B amavis_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amavis_tmp_t context, if you want to store amavis temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B amavis_var_lib_t 
.EE

.EX
.B amavis_var_log_t 
.EE

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.
