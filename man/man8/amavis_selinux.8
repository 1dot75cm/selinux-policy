.SH "NAME"
amavis_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the amavis processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the amavis processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux amavis policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their amavis processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for amavis:


.EX
.B amavis_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amavis_etc_t type, if you want to store amavis files in the /etc directories.

.br
Paths: 
/etc/amavis\.conf, /etc/amavisd(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B amavis_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amavis_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the amavis_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/amavisd.*, /usr/lib/AntiVir/antivir
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B amavis_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amavis_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the amavis_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B amavis_quarantine_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amavis_quarantine_t type, if you want to treat the files as amavis quarantine data.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B amavis_spool_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amavis_spool_t type, if you want to store the amavis files under the /var/spool directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B amavis_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amavis_tmp_t type, if you want to store amavis temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B amavis_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amavis_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the amavis files under the /var/lib directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/lib/amavis(/.*)?, /var/amavis(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B amavis_var_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amavis_var_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as amavis var log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B amavis_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the amavis_var_run_t type, if you want to store the amavis files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux amavis policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their amavis processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for amavis:
.EX

.B amavisd_recv_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 10024
.EE
.EX

.B amavisd_send_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 10025
.EE
.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
