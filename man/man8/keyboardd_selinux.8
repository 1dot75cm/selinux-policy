.SH "NAME"
keyboardd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the keyboardd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the keyboardd processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The keyboardd processes execute with the keyboardd_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier. 

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep keyboardd_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The keyboardd_t SELinux type can be entered via the "keyboardd_exec_t" file type.  The default entrypoint paths for the keyboardd_t domain are the following:"

/usr/bin/system-setup-keyboard
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. 
SELinux keyboardd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their keyboardd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following process types are defined for keyboardd:

.EX
.B keyboardd_t 
.EE
.PP
Note: 
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE 
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux keyboardd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their keyboardd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for keyboardd:


.EX
.PP
.B keyboardd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the keyboardd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the keyboardd_t domain.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type keyboardd_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.
