.SH "NAME"
podsleuth_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the podsleuth processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the podsleuth processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux podsleuth policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their podsleuth processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for podsleuth:


.EX
.B podsleuth_cache_t 
.EE

- Set files with the podsleuth_cache_t type, if you want to store the files under the /var/cache directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B podsleuth_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the podsleuth_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the podsleuth_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/bin/podsleuth, /usr/libexec/hal-podsleuth
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext

.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B podsleuth_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the podsleuth_tmp_t type, if you want to store podsleuth temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B podsleuth_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the podsleuth_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store podsleuth files on a tmpfs file system.
