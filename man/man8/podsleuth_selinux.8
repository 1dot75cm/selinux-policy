.SH "NAME"
podsleuth_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the podsleuth processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the podsleuth processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux podsleuth policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their podsleuth processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for podsleuth:


.EX
.B podsleuth_cache_t 
.EE

- Set files with the podsleuth_cache_t context, if you want to store the files in the /var/cache directories.


.EX
.B podsleuth_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the podsleuth_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the podsleuth_t domain.


.EX
.B podsleuth_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the podsleuth_tmp_t context, if you want to store podsleuth temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B podsleuth_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the podsleuth_tmpfs_t context, if you want to store podsleuth files on a tmpfs file system.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
