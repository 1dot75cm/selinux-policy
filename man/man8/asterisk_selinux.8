.SH "NAME"
asterisk_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the asterisk processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the asterisk processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux asterisk policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their asterisk processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for asterisk:


.EX
.B asterisk_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the asterisk_etc_t context, if you want to store asterisk files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.B asterisk_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the asterisk_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the asterisk_t domain.


.EX
.B asterisk_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the asterisk_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the asterisk_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B asterisk_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the asterisk_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as asterisk log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.B asterisk_spool_t 
.EE

- Set files with the asterisk_spool_t context, if you want to store the asterisk files under the /var/spool directory.


.EX
.B asterisk_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the asterisk_tmp_t context, if you want to store asterisk temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B asterisk_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the asterisk_tmpfs_t context, if you want to store asterisk files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.B asterisk_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the asterisk_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the asterisk files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.B asterisk_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the asterisk_var_run_t context, if you want to store the asterisk files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
