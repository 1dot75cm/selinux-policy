.SH "NAME"
mrtg_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the mrtg processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the mrtg processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH NSSWITCH DOMAIN

.PP
If you want to allow users to resolve user passwd entries directly from ldap rather then using a sssd serve for the mrtg_t, you must turn on the authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P authlogin_nsswitch_use_ldap 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow confined applications to run with kerberos for the mrtg_t, you must turn on the kerberos_enabled boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P kerberos_enabled 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux mrtg policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their mrtg processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for mrtg:


.EX
.PP
.B mrtg_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mrtg_etc_t type, if you want to store mrtg files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.PP
.B mrtg_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mrtg_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the mrtg_t domain.


.EX
.PP
.B mrtg_lock_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mrtg_lock_t type, if you want to treat the files as mrtg lock data, stored under the /var/lock directory

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/var/lock/mrtg(/.*)?, /etc/mrtg/mrtg\.ok

.EX
.PP
.B mrtg_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mrtg_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as mrtg log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.PP
.B mrtg_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mrtg_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the mrtg files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.PP
.B mrtg_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mrtg_var_run_t type, if you want to store the mrtg files under the /run directory.


.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. 
SELinux mrtg policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their mrtg processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following process types are defined for mrtg:

.EX
.B mrtg_t 
.EE
.PP
Note: 
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE 
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux user type mrtg_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.SH "COMMANDS"
.B semanage fcontext
can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.
.PP
.B semanage permissive
can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.
.PP
.B semanage module
can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
