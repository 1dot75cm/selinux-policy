.SH "NAME"
mrtg_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the mrtg processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the mrtg processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux mrtg policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their mrtg processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for mrtg:


.EX
.B mrtg_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mrtg_etc_t type, if you want to store mrtg files in the /etc directories.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B mrtg_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mrtg_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the mrtg_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B mrtg_lock_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mrtg_lock_t type, if you want to treat the files as mrtg lock data, stored under the /var/lock directory

.br
Paths: 
/var/lock/mrtg(/.*)?, /etc/mrtg/mrtg\.ok
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B mrtg_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mrtg_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as mrtg log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B mrtg_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mrtg_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the mrtg files under the /var/lib directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B mrtg_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the mrtg_var_run_t type, if you want to store the mrtg files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
