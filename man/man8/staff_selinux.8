.SH "NAME"
staff_u \- \fBAdministrator's unprivileged user role\fP - Security Enhanced Linux Policy 

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBstaff_u\fP is an SELinux User defined in the SELinux
policy. SELinux users have default roles, \fBstaff_r\fP.  The
default role has a default type, \fBstaff_t\fP, associated with it.

The SELinux user will usually login to a system with a context that looks like:

.B staff_u:staff_r:staff_u:s0-s0:c0.c1023

Linux users are automatically assigned an SELinux users at login.  
Login programs use the SELinux User to assign initial context to the user's shell.

SELinux policy uses the context to control the user's access.

By default all users are assigned to the SELinux user via the \fB__default__\fP flag

On Targeted policy systems the \fB__default__\fP user is assigned to the \fBunconfined_u\fP SELinux user.

You can list all Linux User to SELinux user mapping using:

.B semanage login -l

If you wanted to change the default user mapping to use the staff_u user, you would execute:

.B semanage login -m -s staff_u __default__


If you want to map the one Linux user (joe) to the SELinux user staff, you would execute:

.B $ semanage login -a -s staff_u joe


.SH USER DESCRIPTION

The SELinux user staff_u is defined in policy as a unprivileged user. SELinux prevents unprivileged users from doing administration tasks without transitioning to a different role.

.SH SUDO

The SELinux user staff can execute sudo. 

You can set up sudo to allow staff to transition to an administrative domain:

Add one or more of the following record to sudoers using visudo.


USERNAME ALL=(ALL) ROLE=ftpadmin_r TYPE=ftpadmin_t COMMAND
.br
sudo will run COMMAND as staff_u:ftpadmin_r:ftpadmin_t:LEVEL

USERNAME ALL=(ALL) ROLE=auditadm_r TYPE=auditadm_t COMMAND
.br
sudo will run COMMAND as staff_u:auditadm_r:auditadm_t:LEVEL

USERNAME ALL=(ALL) ROLE=dbadm_r TYPE=dbadm_t COMMAND
.br
sudo will run COMMAND as staff_u:dbadm_r:dbadm_t:LEVEL

USERNAME ALL=(ALL) ROLE=logadm_r TYPE=logadm_t COMMAND
.br
sudo will run COMMAND as staff_u:logadm_r:logadm_t:LEVEL

USERNAME ALL=(ALL) ROLE=secadm_r TYPE=secadm_t COMMAND
.br
sudo will run COMMAND as staff_u:secadm_r:secadm_t:LEVEL

USERNAME ALL=(ALL) ROLE=sysadm_r TYPE=sysadm_t COMMAND
.br
sudo will run COMMAND as staff_u:sysadm_r:sysadm_t:LEVEL

USERNAME ALL=(ALL) ROLE=unconfined_r TYPE=unconfined_t COMMAND
.br
sudo will run COMMAND as staff_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:LEVEL

USERNAME ALL=(ALL) ROLE=webadm_r TYPE=webadm_t COMMAND
.br
sudo will run COMMAND as staff_u:webadm_r:webadm_t:LEVEL

You might also need to add one or more of these new roles to your SELinux user record.

List the SELinux roles your SELinux user can reach by executing:

.B $ semanage user -l |grep selinux_name

Modify the roles list and add staff_r to this list.

.B $ semanage user -m -R 'staff_r ftpadmin_r auditadm_r dbadm_r logadm_r secadm_r sysadm_r unconfined_r webadm_r' staff_u 

For more details you can see semanage man page.


.SH X WINDOWS LOGIN

The SELinux user staff_u is able to X Windows login.

.SH TERMINAL LOGIN

The SELinux user staff_u is able to terminal login.

.SH NETWORK

.TP
The SELinux user staff_u is able to listen on the following tcp ports.

.B xserver_port_t: 6000-6020

.TP
The SELinux user staff_u is able to listen on the following udp ports.

.B all ports with out defined types

.TP
The SELinux user staff_u is able to connect to the following tcp ports.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  staff_t policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run staff_t with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow users to connect to the local mysql server, you must turn on the allow_user_mysql_connect boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P allow_user_mysql_connect 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to control users use of ping and traceroute, you must turn on the user_ping boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P user_ping 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow w to display everyone, you must turn on the user_ttyfile_stat boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P user_ttyfile_stat 1

.EX
.B setsebool -P user_rw_noexattrfile 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow users to run TCP servers (bind to ports and accept connection from the same domain and outside users)  disabling this forces FTP passive mode and may change other protocols, you must turn on the user_tcp_server boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P user_tcp_server 1
.EE

.EE

.SH HOME_EXEC

The SELinux user staff_u is able execute home content files.

.SH TRANSITIONS

Three things can happen when staff_t attempts to execute a program.

\fB1.\fP SELinux Policy can deny staff_t from executing the program.

.TP

\fB2.\fP SELinux Policy can allow staff_t to execute the program in the current user type.

Execute the following to see the types that the SELinux user staff_t can execute without transitioning:

.B sesearch -A -s staff_t -c file -p execute_no_trans

.TP

\fB3.\fP SELinux can allow staff_t to execute the program and transition to a new type.

Execute the following to see the types that the SELinux user staff_t can execute and transition:

.B $ sesearch -A -s staff_t -c process -p transition


.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage login
can also be used to manipulate the Linux User to SELinux User mappings

.B semanage user
can also be used to manipulate SELinux user definitions.

.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
