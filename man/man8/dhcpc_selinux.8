.SH "NAME"
dhcpc_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the dhcpc processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the dhcpc processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux dhcpc policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their dhcpc processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for dhcpc:


.EX
.B dhcpc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dhcpc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the dhcpc_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/sbin/dhcpcd, /usr/sbin/pump, /sbin/dhclient.*, /usr/sbin/dhcpcd, /sbin/pump, /usr/sbin/dhclient.*, /usr/sbin/dhcdbd, /sbin/dhcdbd

.EX
.B dhcpc_helper_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dhcpc_helper_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the dhcpc_helper_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/etc/firestarter/firestarter\.sh

.EX
.B dhcpc_state_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dhcpc_state_t context, if you want to treat the files as dhcpc state data.

.br
Paths: 
/var/lib/dhclient(/.*)?, /var/lib/dhcp3?/dhclient.*, /var/lib/wifiroamd(/.*)?, /var/lib/dhcpcd(/.*)?

.EX
.B dhcpc_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dhcpc_tmp_t context, if you want to store dhcpc temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B dhcpc_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dhcpc_var_run_t context, if you want to store the dhcpc files under the /run directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/run/dhclient.*
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  dhcpc policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run dhcpc with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow dhcpc client applications to execute iptables command, you must turn on the dhcpc_exec_iptables boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P dhcpc_exec_iptables 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
