.SH "NAME"
fingerd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the fingerd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the fingerd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux fingerd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their fingerd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for fingerd:


.EX
.B fingerd_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the fingerd_etc_t context, if you want to store fingerd files in the /etc directories.

.br
Path: 
/etc/cfingerd(/.*)?

.EX
.B fingerd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the fingerd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the fingerd_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/etc/cron\.weekly/(c)?fingerd, /usr/sbin/[cef]fingerd, /usr/sbin/in\.fingerd

.EX
.B fingerd_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the fingerd_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as fingerd log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/log/cfingerd\.log.*

.EX
.B fingerd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the fingerd_var_run_t context, if you want to store the fingerd files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
