.SH "NAME"
icecast_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the icecast processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the icecast processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux icecast policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their icecast processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for icecast:


.EX
.B icecast_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the icecast_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the icecast_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/usr/bin/icecast

.EX
.B icecast_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the icecast_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the icecast_initrc_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/icecast

.EX
.B icecast_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the icecast_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as icecast log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/log/icecast(/.*)?

.EX
.B icecast_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the icecast_var_run_t context, if you want to store the icecast files under the /run directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/run/icecast(/.*)?
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  icecast policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run icecast with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow icecast to connect to all ports, not just sound ports, you must turn on the icecast_connect_any boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P icecast_connect_any 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
