.SH "NAME"
init_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the init processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the init processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux init policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their init processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for init:


.EX
.B init_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the init_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the init_t domain.


.EX
.B init_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the init_var_run_t context, if you want to store the init files under the /run directory.


.EX
.B initctl_t 
.EE

- Set files with the initctl_t context, if you want to treat the files as initctl data.


.EX
.B initrc_devpts_t 
.EE

- Set files with the initrc_devpts_t context, if you want to treat the files as initrc devpts data.


.EX
.B initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B initrc_state_t 
.EE

- Set files with the initrc_state_t context, if you want to treat the files as initrc state data.


.EX
.B initrc_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the initrc_tmp_t context, if you want to store initrc temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B initrc_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the initrc_var_run_t context, if you want to store the initrc files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  init policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run init with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to enable support for upstart as the init program, you must turn on the init_upstart boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P init_upstart 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to enable support for systemd as the init program, you must turn on the init_systemd boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P init_systemd 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
