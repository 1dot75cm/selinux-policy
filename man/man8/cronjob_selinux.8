.SH "NAME"
cronjob_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the cronjob processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the cronjob processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The cronjob processes execute with the cronjob_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier.

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep cronjob_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The cronjob_t SELinux type can be entered via the \fBuser_cron_spool_t, shell_exec_t\fP file types.

The default entrypoint paths for the cronjob_t domain are the following:

/var/spool/at(/.*)?, /var/spool/cron, /bin/d?ash, /bin/zsh.*, /bin/ksh.*, /usr/bin/d?ash, /usr/bin/ksh.*, /usr/bin/zsh.*, /bin/esh, /bin/mksh, /bin/sash, /bin/tcsh, /bin/yash, /bin/bash, /bin/fish, /bin/bash2, /usr/bin/esh, /usr/bin/fish, /usr/bin/bash, /usr/bin/mksh, /usr/bin/sash, /usr/bin/tcsh, /usr/bin/yash, /sbin/nologin, /usr/sbin/sesh, /usr/bin/bash2, /usr/sbin/smrsh, /usr/bin/scponly, /usr/sbin/nologin, /usr/libexec/sesh, /usr/sbin/scponlyc, /usr/bin/git-shell, /usr/libexec/git-core/git-shell
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files.
SELinux cronjob policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their cronjob processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP
The following process types are defined for cronjob:

.EX
.B cronjob_t
.EE
.PP
Note:
.B semanage permissive -a cronjob_t
can be used to make the process type cronjob_t permissive. SELinux does not deny access to permissive process types, but the AVC (SELinux denials) messages are still generated.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  cronjob policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run cronjob with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow sysadm to debug or ptrace all processes, you must turn on the deny_ptrace boolean. Enabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P deny_ptrace 1

.EE

.PP
If you want to allow all domains to use other domains file descriptors, you must turn on the domain_fd_use boolean. Enabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P domain_fd_use 1

.EE

.PP
If you want to allow all domains to have the kernel load modules, you must turn on the domain_kernel_load_modules boolean. Disabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P domain_kernel_load_modules 1

.EE

.PP
If you want to allow all domains to execute in fips_mode, you must turn on the fips_mode boolean. Enabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P fips_mode 1

.EE

.PP
If you want to enable reading of urandom for all domains, you must turn on the global_ssp boolean. Disabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P global_ssp 1

.EE

.PP
If you want to allow system to run with NIS, you must turn on the nis_enabled boolean. Disabled by default.

.EX
.B setsebool -P nis_enabled 1

.EE

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type cronjob_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B user_home_t

	/home/[^/]*/.+
.br
	/home/pwalsh/.+
.br
	/home/dwalsh/.+
.br
	/var/lib/xguest/home/xguest/.+
.br

.br
.B user_tmp_t

	/var/run/user(/.*)?
.br
	/tmp/gconfd-.*
.br
	/tmp/gconfd-pwalsh
.br
	/tmp/gconfd-dwalsh
.br
	/tmp/gconfd-xguest
.br
