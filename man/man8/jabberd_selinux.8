SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux jabberd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their jabberd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for jabberd:


.EX
.B jabberd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the jabberd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the jabberd_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/bin/s2s, /usr/bin/sm

.EX
.B jabberd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the jabberd_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the jabberd_initrc_t domain.

command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.
