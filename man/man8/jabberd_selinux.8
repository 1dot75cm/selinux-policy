.SH "NAME"
jabberd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the jabberd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the jabberd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux jabberd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their jabberd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for jabberd:


.EX
.B jabberd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the jabberd_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the jabberd_t domain.


.EX
.B jabberd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the jabberd_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the jabberd_initrc_t domain.


.EX
.B jabberd_router_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the jabberd_router_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the jabberd_router_t domain.


.EX
.B jabberd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the jabberd_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the jabberd files under the /var/lib directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"
