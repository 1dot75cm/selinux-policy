.SH "NAME"
jabberd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the jabberd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the jabberd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux jabberd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their jabberd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for jabberd:


.EX
.B jabberd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the jabberd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the jabberd_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/bin/s2s, /usr/bin/sm
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B jabberd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the jabberd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the jabberd_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B jabberd_router_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the jabberd_router_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the jabberd_router_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/bin/c2s, /usr/bin/router
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B jabberd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the jabberd_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the jabberd files under the /var/lib directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux jabberd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their jabberd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for jabberd:
.EX

.B jabber_client_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 5222,5223
.EE
.EX

.B jabber_interserver_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 5269
.EE
.EX

.B jabber_router_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 5347
.EE
.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
