.SH "NAME"
ccs_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the ccs processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the ccs processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The ccs processes execute with the ccs_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the \fBps\fP command with the \fB\-Z\fP qualifier. 

For example:

.B ps -eZ | grep ccs_t


.SH "ENTRYPOINTS"

The ccs_t SELinux type can be entered via the "ccs_exec_t" file type.  The default entrypoint paths for the ccs_t domain are the following:"

/usr/sbin/ccsd, /sbin/ccsd
.SH PROCESS TYPES
SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system
.PP
You can see the context of a process using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBps\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. 
SELinux ccs policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ccs processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following process types are defined for ccs:

.EX
.B ccs_t 
.EE
.PP
Note: 
.B semanage permissive -a PROCESS_TYPE 
can be used to make a process type permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux ccs policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ccs processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for ccs:


.EX
.PP
.B ccs_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ccs_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the ccs_t domain.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/ccsd, /sbin/ccsd

.EX
.PP
.B ccs_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ccs_tmp_t type, if you want to store ccs temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.PP
.B ccs_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ccs_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store ccs files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.PP
.B ccs_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ccs_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the ccs files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.PP
.B ccs_var_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ccs_var_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as ccs var log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.


.EX
.PP
.B ccs_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ccs_var_run_t type, if you want to store the ccs files under the /run directory.

.br
.TP 5
Paths: 
/var/run/cluster/ccsd\.pid, /var/run/cluster/ccsd\.sock

.PP
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "MANAGED FILES"

The SELinux process type ccs_t can manage files labeled with the following file types.  The paths listed are the default paths for these file types.  Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

.br
.B ccs_tmp_t


.br
.B ccs_tmpfs_t


.br
.B ccs_var_lib_t


.br
.B ccs_var_log_t
