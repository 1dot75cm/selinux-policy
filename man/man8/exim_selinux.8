.SH "NAME"
exim_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the exim processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the exim processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux exim policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their exim processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for exim:


.EX
.B exim_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the exim_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the exim_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/sbin/exim[0-9]?, /usr/sbin/exim_tidydb

.EX
.B exim_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the exim_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the exim_initrc_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/exim

.EX
.B exim_keytab_t 
.EE

- Set files with the exim_keytab_t context, if you want to treat the files as kerberos keytab files.


.EX
.B exim_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the exim_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as exim log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/log/exim[0-9]?(/.*)?

.EX
.B exim_spool_t 
.EE

- Set files with the exim_spool_t context, if you want to store the exim files under the /var/spool directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/spool/exim[0-9]?(/.*)?

.EX
.B exim_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the exim_tmp_t context, if you want to store exim temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B exim_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the exim_var_run_t context, if you want to store the exim files under the /run directory.

.br
Path: 
/var/run/exim[0-9]?\.pid
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  exim policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run exim with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow exim to read unprivileged user files, you must turn on the exim_read_user_files boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P exim_read_user_files 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow exim to connect to databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, you must turn on the exim_can_connect_db boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P exim_can_connect_db 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow exim to create, read, write, and delete unprivileged user files, you must turn on the exim_manage_user_files boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P exim_manage_user_files 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
