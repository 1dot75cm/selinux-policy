.SH "NAME"
dlm_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the dlm processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the dlm processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux dlm policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their dlm processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for dlm:


.EX
.B dlm_controld_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dlm_controld_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the dlm_controld_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B dlm_controld_tmpfs_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dlm_controld_tmpfs_t type, if you want to store dlm controld files on a tmpfs file system.


.EX
.B dlm_controld_var_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dlm_controld_var_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as dlm controld var log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B dlm_controld_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the dlm_controld_var_run_t type, if you want to store the dlm controld files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.
