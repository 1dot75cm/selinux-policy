.SH "NAME"
unconfined_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the unconfined processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the unconfined processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  unconfined policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run unconfined with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow database admins to execute DML statemen, you must turn on the sepgsql_unconfined_dbadm boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P sepgsql_unconfined_dbadm 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow unconfined users to transition to the Mozilla plugin domain when running xulrunner plugin-container, you must turn on the unconfined_mozilla_plugin_transition boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P unconfined_mozilla_plugin_transition 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow a user to login as an unconfined domai, you must turn on the unconfined_login boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P unconfined_login 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow unconfined users to transition to the chrome sandbox domains when running chrome-sandbo, you must turn on the unconfined_chrome_sandbox_transition boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P unconfined_chrome_sandbox_transition 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow samba to run unconfined script, you must turn on the samba_run_unconfined boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P samba_run_unconfined 1
.EE

.PP
If you want to allow video playing tools to run unconfine, you must turn on the unconfined_mplayer boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P unconfined_mplayer 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux unconfined policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their unconfined processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for unconfined:


.EX
.B unconfined_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the unconfined_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the unconfined_t domain.

.br
Paths: 
/usr/bin/vncserver, /usr/sbin/xrdp, /usr/sbin/xrdp-sesman
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
