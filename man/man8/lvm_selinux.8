.SH "NAME"
lvm_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the lvm processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the lvm processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE_CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux lvm policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their lvm processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for lvm:


.EX
.B lvm_etc_t 
.EE

- Set files with the lvm_etc_t context, if you want to store lvm files in the /etc directories.


.EX
.B lvm_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the lvm_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the lvm_t domain.


.EX
.B lvm_lock_t 
.EE

- Set files with the lvm_lock_t context, if you want to treat the files as lvm lock data.


.EX
.B lvm_metadata_t 
.EE

- Set files with the lvm_metadata_t context, if you want to treat the files as lvm metadata data.


.EX
.B lvm_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the lvm_tmp_t context, if you want to store lvm temporary files in the /tmp directories.


.EX
.B lvm_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the lvm_var_lib_t context, if you want to store the lvm files under the /var/lib directory.


.EX
.B lvm_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the lvm_var_run_t context, if you want to store the lvm files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  lvm policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run lvm with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow piranha-lvs domain to connect to the network using TCP., you must turn on the piranha_lvs_can_network_connect boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P piranha_lvs_can_network_connect 1
.EE

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
