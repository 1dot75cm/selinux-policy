.SH "NAME"
collectd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the collectd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the collectd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  collectd policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run collectd with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow collectd to connect to the network using TCP, you must turn on the collectd_can_network_connect boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P collectd_can_network_connect 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux collectd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their collectd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for collectd:


.EX
.B collectd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the collectd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the collectd_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B collectd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the collectd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the collectd_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B collectd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the collectd_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the collectd files under the /var/lib directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B collectd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the collectd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the collectd files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
