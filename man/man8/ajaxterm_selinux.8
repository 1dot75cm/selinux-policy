.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux ajaxterm policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their ajaxterm processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for ajaxterm:


.EX
.B ajaxterm_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ajaxterm_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the ajaxterm_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/usr/share/ajaxterm/ajaxterm\.py

.EX
.B ajaxterm_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ajaxterm_initrc_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the ajaxterm_initrc_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/etc/rc\.d/init\.d/ajaxterm

.EX
.B ajaxterm_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the ajaxterm_var_run_t context, if you want to store the ajaxterm files under the /run directory.

/var/run/ajaxterm\.pid
Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.
