.SH "NAME"
iwhd_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the iwhd processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the iwhd processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux iwhd policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their iwhd processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for iwhd:


.EX
.B iwhd_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the iwhd_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the iwhd_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B iwhd_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the iwhd_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the iwhd_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B iwhd_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the iwhd_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as iwhd log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B iwhd_var_lib_t 
.EE

- Set files with the iwhd_var_lib_t type, if you want to store the iwhd files under the /var/lib directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B iwhd_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the iwhd_var_run_t type, if you want to store the iwhd files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
