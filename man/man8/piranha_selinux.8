.SH "NAME"
piranha_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the piranha processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the piranha processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  

.SH BOOLEANS
SELinux policy is customizable based on least access required.  piranha policy is extremely flexible and has several booleans that allow you to manipulate the policy and run piranha with the tightest access possible.


.PP
If you want to allow piranha-lvs domain to connect to the network using TCP, you must turn on the piranha_lvs_can_network_connect boolean.

.EX
.B setsebool -P piranha_lvs_can_network_connect 1
.EE

.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux piranha policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their piranha processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for piranha:


.EX
.B piranha_etc_rw_t 
.EE

- Set files with the piranha_etc_rw_t type, if you want to treat the files as piranha etc read/write content.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B piranha_fos_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the piranha_fos_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the piranha_fos_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use

to apply the labels.


.EX

.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX

.EE

- Set files with the piranha_log_t type, if you want to treat the data as piranha log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext

.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX

.EE

- Set files with the piranha_lvs_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the piranha_lvs_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B piranha_lvs_var_run_t 
.EE

- Set files with the piranha_lvs_var_run_t type, if you want to store the piranha lvs files under the /run directory.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B piranha_pulse_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the piranha_pulse_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the piranha_pulse_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.


.EX
.B piranha_pulse_initrc_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the piranha_pulse_initrc_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the piranha_pulse_initrc_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon

.SH PORT TYPES
SELinux defines port types to represent TCP and UDP ports. 
.PP
You can see the types associated with a port by using the following command: 

.B semanage port -l

.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these ports. 
SELinux piranha policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their piranha processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following port types are defined for piranha:
.EX

.B piranha_port_t 
.EE

.EX
Default Defined Ports:

.B tcp 3636
.EE
.SH "COMMANDS"

.B semanage boolean
can also be used to manipulate the booleans

.PP
.B system-config-selinux 
is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
