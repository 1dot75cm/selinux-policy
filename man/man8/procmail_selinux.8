.SH "NAME"
procmail_selinux \- Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the procmail processes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Security-Enhanced Linux secures the procmail processes via flexible mandatory access
control.  
.SH FILE CONTEXTS
SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type. 
.PP
You can see the context of a file using the \fB\-Z\fP option to \fBls\bP
.PP
Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. 
SELinux procmail policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their procmail processes in as secure a method as possible.
.PP 
The following file types are defined for procmail:


.EX
.B procmail_exec_t 
.EE

- Set files with the procmail_exec_t context, if you want to a executable to transition to the procmail_t domain.

.br
Path: 
/usr/bin/procmail

.EX
.B procmail_home_t 
.EE

- Set files with the procmail_home_t context, if you want to store procmail files in the users home directory.

.br
Path: 
/root/\.procmailrc

.EX
.B procmail_log_t 
.EE

- Set files with the procmail_log_t context, if you want to treat the data as procmail log data, usually stored under the /var/log directory.

.br
Paths: 
/var/log/procmail\.log.*, /var/log/procmail(/.*)?

.EX
.B procmail_tmp_t 
.EE

- Set files with the procmail_tmp_t context, if you want to store procmail temporary files in the /tmp directories.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command.  If you want to permanantly change the file context you need to use the 
.B semanage fcontext 
command.  This will modify the SELinux labeling database.  You will need to use
.B restorecon
to apply the labels.
